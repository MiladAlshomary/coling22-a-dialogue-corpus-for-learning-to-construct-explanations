that's kind of trivial to you and me,","because of course you have space,","which is three dimensional, you have time","which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional.","But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone","that that was a sensible way to talk","until really relativity.","This is the crucial thing, right?","Is that what Einstein realized is that","sure there's both time and space, but how we divide","spacetime into time and space can be different","for different people, and really there's a real sense","in which four dimensional spacetime","is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space.","And I think to really explain this","we're gonna need a blackboard."],"1115":["Okay."],"993":["Let's bring one in.","All right.","The thing about relativity","is that they really want you to think","of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right?","It's kind of like space.","It's not just three dimensions of space","and one dimension of time."],"1116":["Why though?"],"994":["Why?","This is a very good question.","So, let's just start with space, right?","We know a little bit about space.","So here's my simple minded way of drawing space","two dimensions, because that's how many","I can draw on the blackboard.","Let's say X and Y.","And what is special about space, there's many things,","but one is that if I have a curve or a path","between two points, there's a distance","that you can calculate, right?","And the distance between those two points","doesn't depend on your coordinates.","It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates","or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever.","I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this","between those two points, and if I were a person","walking on that curve, I would have an odometer","with me maybe, and I would know, you would know,","even without having done that,","this path is always gonna be longer than that path.","There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem","that tells you what the shortest distance path is.","That's the point.","The physical-ness of what is real","is the distance along a certain curve.","So spacetime is like that.","That's why it is useful to think about spacetime."],"1117":["Okay."],"995":["So let me draw spacetime.","Here's how we usually draw it.","I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed","in this one direction, and this is time, okay?","So if you're a little person","and you started some event, so you start,","you're located somewhere in space,","somewhere in the three coordinates of space,","and whether you like it or not, you're moving","through spacetime just by getting older."],"1118":["Yeah."],"996":["When people ask me can you travel through time?","I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future","and here I am, a day later.","So that's just this.","Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not.","So what Einstein says is look, I can travel","through spacetime in different ways,","like I could hop in a rocket ship","and fly out and then fly back,","and then I could meet you there.","So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?"],"1119":["Yeah."],"997":["And it's almost exactly like the space story.","The space story says there's a distance,","distance is different along different curves.","Einstein says there's something that measures","the length of these curves,","and we call it the proper time.","It is literally the time that you would read","on your wristwatch."],"1120":["So it's kind of like our fundamental time?","Or our base time?"],"998":["Well kind of.","What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing","as fundamental, like there's the universe's time,","this big letter T that might tell you how old","the universe is, but then every individual","has a clock with them, and they measure their own time","depending on how they're moving through the universe."],"1121":["I see."],"999":["And the crucial difference is","that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind","and sat in their chair,","and this person who zoomed out there."],"1122":["Why is that, that this one's shorter then?"],"1000":["There is what we call a metric on spacetime,","and when we talk about Euclidean space","versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something,","that's a different metric.","And spacetime has its own metric","which says the following thing,","that the path between two events in spacetime","that is a straight line, will always be the longest time."],"1123":["I see.","Oh, okay."],"1001":["[Sean] That's the difference."],"1124":["All right."],"1002":["So when Einstein had this idea,","oh gravity could be related to the curvature","of spacetime, he did some equations,","so he got it, that's a long story,","we'll put that aside.","What he figured out was that rather than gravity","living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation","of the curvature of spacetime","so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon,","they cause a gravitational field,","they're actually warping the spacetime around them.","They're giving it a different geometry."],"1125":["Would it be if I had like a spring","or not a spring, but like a sheet,","and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?"],"1003":["Yeah, exactly.","If you had a sheet that was originally flat,","and you set a marble on it,","it would go in a straight line,","but then if you put something on it","so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected."],"1126":["I see."],"1004":["Einstein says that gravity is just like that."],"1127":["I see."],"1005":["But there are no straight lines,","because spacetime itself is curved.","So do you think if you had to explain relativity","what would you say?"],"1128":["I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox.","Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me","on the train, they think they're stationary on the train.","Like they think that they're not accelerating,","but if they start walking through the train cars,","then they are accelerating in their frame,","but then from my outside frame","where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating.","So I guess that relativity is all about perspective,","I guess in a way."],"1006":["Yeah, that's right.","And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board","where how those two people in the train and on the ground","would divide spacetime up differently","to space and time."],"1129":["That was pretty good."],"1007":["[Sean] Yeah.","I learned a lot.","[Sean] It's a lot of fun stuff to talk about."]},"turn_sentences":{"984":["Where do you go to school and what do you study?"],"1107":["I'm gonna be a

kind of like space.","It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time."],"1116":["Why though?"],"994":["Why?","This is a very good question.","So, let's just start with space, right?","We know a little bit about space.","So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard.","Let's say X and Y.","And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right?","And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates.","It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever.","I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path.","There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is.","That's the point.","The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve.","So spacetime is like that.","That's why it is useful to think about spacetime."],"1117":["Okay."],"995":["So let me draw spacetime.","Here's how we usually draw it.","I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay?","So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older."],"1118":["Yeah."],"996":["When people ask me can you travel through time?","I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later.","So that's just this.","Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not.","So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there.","So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?"],"1119":["Yeah."],"997":["And it's almost exactly like the space story.","The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves.","Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time.","It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch."],"1120":["So it's kind of like our fundamental time?","Or our base time?"],"998":["Well kind of.","What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe."],"1121":["I see."],"999":["And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there."],"1122":["Why is that, that this one's shorter then?"],"1000":["There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric.","And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time."],"1123":["I see.","Oh, okay."],"1001":["[Sean] That's the difference."],"1124":["All right."],"1002":["So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside.","What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them.","They're giving it a different geometry."],"1125":["Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?"],"1003":["Yeah, exactly.","If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected."],"1126":["I see."],"1004":["Einstein says that gravity is just like that."],"1127":["I see."],"1005":["But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved.","So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?"],"1128":["I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox.","Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train.","Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating.","So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way."],"1006":["Yeah, that's right.","And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time."],"1129":["That was pretty good."],"1007":["[Sean] Yeah.","I learned a lot.","[Sean] It's a lot of fun stuff to talk about."]},"turn_num_tokens":{"984":12,"1107":18,"985":22,"1108":22,"986":18,"1109":2,"987":34,"1110":4,"988":24,"1111":10,"989":2,"1112":64,"990":13,"1113":2,"991":9,"1114":2,"992":142,"1115":2,"993":52,"1116":3,"994":249,"1117":2,"995":88,"1118":2,"996":101,"1119":2,"997":60,"1120":15,"998":67,"1121":3,"999":31,"1122":11,"1000":67,"1123":7,"1001":8,"1124":3,"1002":101,"1125":31,"1003":52,"1126":3,"1004":9,"1127":3,"1005":28,"1128":99,"1006":40,"1129":5,"1007":24},"role":{"984":"Explainer","1107":"Explainee","985":"Explainer","1108":"Explainee","986":"Explainer","1109":"Explainee","987":"Explainer","1110":"Explainee","988":"Explainer","1111":"Explainee","989":"Explainer","1112":"Explainee","990":"Explainer","1113":"Explainee","991":"Explainer","1114":"Explainee","992":"Explainer","1115":"Explainee","993":"Explainer","1116":"Explainee","994":"Explainer","1117":"Explainee","995":"Explainer","1118":"Explainee","996":"Explainer","1119":"Explainee","997":"Explainer","1120":"Explainee","998":"Explainer","1121":"Explainee","999":"Explainer","1122":"Explainee","1000":"Explainer","1123":"Explainee","1001":"Explainer","1124":"Explainee","1002":"Explainer","1125":"Explainee","1003":"Explainer","1126":"Explainee","1004":"Explainer","1127":"Explainee","1005":"Explainer","1128":"Explainee","1006":"Explainer","1129":"Explainee","1007":"Explainer"}}

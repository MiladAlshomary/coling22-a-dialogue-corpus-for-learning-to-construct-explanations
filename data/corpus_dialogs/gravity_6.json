you're getting your PhD in physics?"],"631":["That's right.","Theoretical high energy physics.","Basically the physics of","really, really small fundamental things."],"543":["So what would that have to do","with gravity or astrophysics?"],"632":["Well, what I'm looking at is states of matter","that might exist inside neutron stars.","So, when a star dies, if the star is massive enough,","there's a huge explosion, called a supernova,","and the stuff that's left behind","that doesn't get blown away","collapses into a tiny compact blob","called a neutron star."],"544":["So what I love about neutron stars personally","is that they're kind of city-sized,","right?"],"633":["That's right."],"545":["[Janna] They're about the size of a city.","So you're imagining something","more than the mass of the Sun."],"634":["[Will] Yeah, or about the mass of the Sun,","condensed to the size of a city.","It's dense enough that one teaspoon-full","would weigh about a billion tons here on Earth."],"546":["Now, that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong","around the neutron star.","So what would happen if we were on a neutron star,","because of the gravity?"],"635":["We would immediately be crushed into the ground,","I think our bodies would be shred","into their subatomic particles."],"547":["So what's the connection","between neutron stars and black holes?"],"636":["So, as I understand it,","a black hole is sort of like a neutron star's big brother.","It's more intense, though.","If you have so much matter when a star is collapsing","that it can't hold itself up, it collapses to a black hole,","and those are so dense that space-time breaks down","in some way or another."],"548":["Black holes are so amazing","that when the neutron star stops","and there's something actually there.","There's material there.","If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole,","so it keeps falling,","once the event horizon of the black hole forms,","which is the shadow,","the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape,","the material keeps falling.","And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down","right at the center there, but whatever happens,","the star's gone, that black hole is empty.","So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing."],"637":["So is there a sensible way to talk","about what's inside a black hole,","or is that, should you think of it","as there is no space-time inside?"],"549":["There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet,","and that probably means that's where Einstein's","theory of gravity as a curved space-time","is beginning to break down,","and we need to take the extra step","of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity.","And we don't have that yet.","So even though the black hole isn't completely understood,","we do know that they form astronomically,","that in the universe things like neutron stars form","and things like black holes form.","The consequences are very much speaking","to this curved space-time.","So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other,","they're like mallets on a drum,","and they actually cause space-time to ring,","and it's very much part of gravitation.","The ringing of space-time itself,","we call gravitational waves.","And this was something Einstein thought about","right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that."],"638":["Those waves are very exciting for me too","because neutron stars orbiting each other","also give off gravitational waves","and we might be able to get some data","about neutron star material from that kind of signal."],"550":["[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum,","and you can record the sound of that ringing","after a billion years,","when it's traveled through the universe.","But then the next thing that happens is","those neutron stars collide,","and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter,","which you study,","it becomes this firework of different explosions.","It's really quite spectacular."],"639":["That's right, in fact,","when we recorded that for the first time","with gravitational waves,","we then pointed telescopes at it","and were able to see it optically as well,","and that gave scientists a lot of data."],"551":["Yeah, it was, to my knowledge,","the most widely studied astronomical event","in the history of humanity."],"640":["Wow, that's amazing."],"552":["So when the gravitational waves were recorded","and they realized, oh this sounds like,","you can reconstruct the shape and size","of the mallets of the drum from the sound,","these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes.","And so, like you said, there was a trigger","for satellites and experiments all over the world","to point roughly in the direction","that the sound was coming from.","So, from your point of view,","they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding,","an experiment you could never do on Earth.","That's just the most tremendous scales","and peculiarities of matter."],"641":["Absolutely.","I've heard statistics like many Earth masses worth of gold","were created, forged in the neutron star collision","that caused that.","We used to think that most elements in the universe","were created in supernova, which is when stars explode,","because there's so much violent activity at the center","that you need that kind of energy to create new elements."],"553":["[Janna] The way you do in a bomb.","It's basically nuclear fusion."],"642":["Sure, but we now think that that kind of fusion happens","when two neutron stars collide.","If you think about it,","you have two massive blobs of neutrons.","When you smush them together, you've got neutrons colliding.","It creates the conditions where new elements can be created."],"554":["Yeah, it's amazing.","It's literally populating the periodic table."],"643":["Yes, we now think that most of the heavy elements","after some number are created in neutron star collisions."],"555":["So you are already a PhD student,","you know a lot about gravity,","but what do you think you've taken away","from this conversation?"],"644":["Well, I've definitely taken away","that the way that we think about gravity today","is very different from how Newton thought about it,","and that even though we have a very good understanding,","there's lots of things that we don't fully understand.","There's still a lot of questions to be answered,","which I think is really exciting."],"556":["See, you're a scientist.

paper","and the shape, it's almost a circle.","If we take the crane","we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern.","Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing,","and here's the other wing."],"1380":["Okay."],"1326":["The crane has four circles","but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise","because what about this?","There's a fifth circle, which is like

crane."],"1381":["Okay."],"1327":["And to do that","we use a new technique called circle packing","in which all of the long features of the design","are represented by circles.","So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle","and things that can be big and thick,","like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle.","Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern,","we just count the number of legs we want.","We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs,","it's also got an abdomen, that's another point,","and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points.","If we find an arrangement of 10 circles","we should be able to fold that into the spider.","So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books","and has some patterns, and this is one

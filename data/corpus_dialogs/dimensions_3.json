corner."],"948":["Exactly, there you go."],"1072":["Another way is if you have space in between is an angle."],"949":["I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me.","You're much better at this than I am."],"1073":["Yeah."],"950":["So those are the dimensions.","That's how we think about dimensions.","Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane."],"1074":["I think that would be an X or a Y axis, so--"],"951":["There you go."],"952":["So, do you think we could have more than three dimensions?"],"1075":["3D is the maximum of dimensions for shapes."],"953":["Well, as far as we know."],"1076":["Yeah."],"954":["This is why physicists think about things we don't know about.","We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen.","Yeah.","That are tinier than atoms.","So, okay.","So what have you learned?","What do you know about dimensions now?","How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?"],"1077":["So at least everything has a certain dimension."],"955":["Yeah, do you think you'd be excited if physicists said that they found extra dimensions of space?"],"1078":["That would be an amazing discovery.","The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly."],"956":["I think so.","I think you're right.","All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day.","Does that sound like a fun idea?"],"1079":["Yeah."]},"turn_num_tokens":{"930":14,"1054":5,"931":37,"1055":5,"932":8,"1056":8,"933":45,"1057":10,"934":5,"1058":17,"935":8,"1059":5,"936":12,"1060":8,"937":21,"1061":19,"938":6,"1062":5,"939":11,"1063":5,"940":24,"1064":5,"941":11,"1065":15,"942":31,"1066":14,"943":57,"1067":2,"944":11,"1068":5,"945":9,"1069":2,"946":41,"1070":27,"947":41,"1071":12,"948":6,"1072":13,"949":27,"1073":2,"950":39,"1074":14,"951":4,"952":13,"1075":9,"953":8,"1076":2,"954":69,"1077":9,"955":20,"1078":17,"956":46,"1079":2},"role":{"930":"Explainer","1054":"Explainee","931":"Explainer","1055":"Explainee","932":"Explainer","1056":"Explainee","933":"Explainer","1057":"Explainee","934":"Explainer","1058":"Explainee","935":"Explainer","1059":"Explainee","936":"Explainer","1060":"Explainee","937":"Explainer","1061":"Explainee","938":"Explainer","1062":"Explainee","939":"Explainer","1063":"Explainee","940":"Explainer","1064":"Explainee","941":"Explainer","1065":"Explainee","942":"Explainer","1066":"Explainee","943":"Explainer","1067":"Explainee","944":"Explainer","1068":"Explainee","945":"Explainer","1069":"Explainee","946":"Explainer","1070":"Explainee","947":"Explainer","1071":"Explainee","948":"Explainer","1072":"Explainee","949":"Explainer","1073":"Explainee","950":"Explainer","1074":"Explainee","951":"Explainer","952":"Explainer","1075":"Explainee","953":"Explainer","1076":"Explainee","954":"Explainer","1077":"Explainee","955":"Explainer","1078":"Explainee","956":"Explainer","1079":"Explainee"}}

still not gonna get to the Schwinger limit,","isn't that right?"],"914":["So just a little bit of back history again.","After you demonstrated CPA, I was intrigued by","how powerful could we make

long time.","And so we at the university are making proposals","to build two 25 petawatt lasers, maybe 30 petawatt lasers.","We'll use them to be able to get combined power","of over 10 to the 24

challenge?","'Cos it's not like our beams are","as perfect as we like to think they are."],"925":["So that's right so you have to have the aperture size,","you have to have them phase","locked across the entire aperture.","Which will be a great challenge","and people have done it, again, with small lasers.","The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture.","So we'll begin to start looking at this.","And actually wavelength control and then be able","to adaptive optics other ways which","you can control the uniformity of the phase","is something that's been developed in lots of ways now.","For defense applications, for science applications.","So we will do our best to","make use of all these technologies.","Lasers I think have progressed so much.","Just like the semi

everywhere.","We're gonna possibly take over from CERN, we'll just do high energy physics with lasers, we're looking at gravity waves with lasers, we wanna do black holes with lasers, we wanna machine with lasers, we wanna do medicine with lasers.","It's everywhere.","And now, with the Nobel prize, people are hearing more about it so they know lasers are everywhere."],"927":["[Michael] I couldn't agree with you more and you winning the Nobel prize has been an inspiration to lots of people.","Only three women have won the Nobel prize in physics and only one educated in the United

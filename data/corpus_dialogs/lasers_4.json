we're here to talk about lasers.","So what do you think about lasers?"],"876":["I think they're pretty cool.","They show up in a lot of my favorite books and movies.","Like Star Wars or just a bunch of","different sci-fi movies and books."],"806":["Do you know anything about lasers?","What makes a laser special kind of light."],"877":["All I really know is from sci-fi books and movies","and like the factory cutting lasers","that they use to cut steel and stuff."],"807":["Do you even know maybe how to make a laser","that it would be strong enough to cut steel?"],"878":["No."],"808":["Okay. [laughing]","So one of the things about lasers is,","if you've ever seen a laser beam,","you know it's very directed."],"879":["Like what are they made out of?"],"809":["What is a laser made out of?","Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb.","Right?"],"880":["So it's a beam?"],"810":["So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors.","Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special.","It has to be a type of material that can","store the energy in an excited state right?","It has to stay up there really energetic","and sit there for a while so that","when the light comes along,","it takes that energy and becomes stronger light","and then the mirror sends it back","and it does it again and again and again","and between these two mirrors, it makes","the light come out in a nice beam.","In a laser, it comes out as a single color.","They all come out with their waves at the same time.","Every wave peaks at the same time","which then makes it a giant wave","and it's this giant wave that","has a tremendous amount of power.","So it can do something like cutting steel.","But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor,","it's gray, it actually will absorb the light.","That's why the light, you don't see it because the","light isn't bouncing back or through it.","So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works.","So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail.","I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail","before into a piece of wood but the question is,","if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end","and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood.","We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end","and hope this would go in to the piece of wood."],"881":["Because it needs to be centered so","it can more easily just go in."],"811":["That's right.","All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through","but then it can only basically come out","when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot.","And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with","but sometimes it is that force per unit area.","But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area","'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that","and see if we can get it pushed in.","See it doesn't really work does it?"],"882":["So the laser needs ultimately many things.","It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually","penetrate and then it needs--"],"812":["Well it depends.","So if you're cutting steel,","you need to have the nail.","You need to have it concentrated all of the light,","not going in all directions but you","need it into as small a point as possible.","And for that we use a lens.","For a lens, the light's coming down as a column,","you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way","as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel.","Okay so that force per unit area--"],"883":["So it's kind of like a magnifying glass?","Like it magnifies the light down to a point?"],"813":["Exactly.","You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy","not just in a small area but in the small volume","and so one of the other dimensions is time or length.","But with light, time and length are the same thing","because light always travels at the speed of light."],"884":["Exactly."],"814":["But if you send a one second long light pulse","out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse","is actually two thirds of the way to the moon.","It's 300,000 kilometers long.","So now, if you talk about light being","concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated.","The type of lasers I play with in my lab","will be no thicker than this piece of paper.","So we take that energy that might be","in three hundred thousand kilometers and we","squeeze it all the way down into just this","piece of paper and actually the beams","are more the size of this piece of paper","and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this","would be flying through the sky but we can't see them.","'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us","and they're infra red."],"885":["There'd be like little concentrated beams of light","just flying everywhere?"],"815":["Exactly.","And so now, if we have light like","that that we wanna machine with.","I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here","and the light was coming down--"],"886":["It funnels into--"],"816":["Into a spot.","So here would be my light coming from my laser","and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down.","Hit a lens and it would have to focus down.","But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread","so concentrated this much.","Eventually it would be here, more concentrated.","But by the end, right at the focal spot,","that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has","been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper","and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer.","Because when this hits a piece of glass,","it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms","and there's nothing else for them","to do, they have to fly away.","So can you tell me what you learned","and maybe about the focusing of the light?"],"887":["Well what I learned, lasers they aren't like particles.","They're more like a super concentrated beam of light","that can be any color.","They get really concentrated and that's what makes them","lasers and that's why they cut things and break things","because they just move the electrons out of the way."],"817":["So do you think that lasers are fun enough","to talk with your friends about or?"],"888":["Of course I'm gonna have to share","something about my experience.","Learning about lasers with an expert like you."]},"turn_sentences":{"805":["Today we're here to talk

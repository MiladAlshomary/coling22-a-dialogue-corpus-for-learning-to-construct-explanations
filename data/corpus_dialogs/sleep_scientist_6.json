this transition","is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay?","So this term comes from engineering,","and the idea is that in sleep,","you basically have kind of this all of nothing

promoting system,","and it's certainly regulated,","and we'll get a little bit into that,","but they're certainly kind of made up","of two reciprocally inhibitory processes.","Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system.","It originates in the brain stem,","and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this,","and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons,","that go up to the thalamus","and then it projections into the fore brain,","and then there's the ventral arm,","and this is comprised of a whole bunch","of different types of neurons,","so there are monominergic,","so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons","that come from the periaqueductal gray,","serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei,","histaminergic neurons that come","from the

sleep."],"309":["And do we know much about why,","or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected?","You know, if you take amphetamines,","is it then when you go to sleep,","that you're not able to

you learn about sleep today?"],"386":["I guess I learned a system that is,","you know, very heavily regulated and influenced","by some of these older conserved","sub-cortical systems in the

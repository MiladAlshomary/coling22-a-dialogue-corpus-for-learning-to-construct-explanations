looks one dimensional.","A little loop of string,","so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating.","If you look at it from very, very far away,","it just looks like a particle.","So in string

you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface.","This is what we call a brane.","B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?"],"1140":["I've heard it, yeah."],"1019":["[Sean] Do you know where it comes from?"],"1141":["No."],"1020":["From membranes, you know.","We have lines, one dimension.","We have two dimensional surfaces.","So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?"],"1142":["Right."],"1021":["If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane.","Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while.","But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things."],"1143":["So how do these strings give rise to things like mass and charge, and basically give us the properties of the particles that we see?"],"1022":["Well basically the strings are the particles that we see.","It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional.","A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating.","If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle.","So in string theory, an electron is a little string.","A photon is a little string."],"1144":["So, is string theory part of what they call the Grand Unified Theory?","Is it supposed to be the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together?"],"1023":["Yes, string theory's even better.","So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism.","So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory."],"1145":["Okay."],"1024":["It's even better.","It's the theory of everything.","What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?"],"1146":["So we have three spatial dimensions.","A brane is sort of the next level.","So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space."],"1025":["That's right.","And we could live there.","The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape."],"1147":["It was really cool to learn about strings and branes and how looking at gravity on small scales is actually connected to what I do in looking at gravity on these cosmological scales, and it's definitely something I'm gonna think about in my research."]},"turn_num_tokens":{"1008":12,"1130":32,"1009":13,"1131":7,"1010":41,"1132":19,"1011":2,"1133":22,"1012":2,"1134":17,"1013":57,"1135":28,"1014":6,"1136":9,"1015":72,"1137":2,"1016":23,"1138":14,"1017":67,"1139":2,"1018":385,"1140":7,"1019":11,"1141":2,"1020":40,"1142":2,"1021":67,"1143":27,"1022":90,"1144":32,"1023":40,"1145":2,"1024":38,"1146":29,"1025":42,"1147":49},"role":{"1008":"Explainer","1130":"Explainee","1009":"Explainer","1131":"Explainee","1010":"Explainer","1132":"Explainee","1011":"Explainer","1133":"Explainee","1012":"Explainer","1134":"Explainee","1013":"Explainer","1135":"Explainee","1014":"Explainer","1136":"Explainee","1015":"Explainer","1137":"Explainee","1016":"Explainer","1138":"Explainee","1017":"Explainer","1139":"Explainee","1018":"Explainer","1140":"Explainee","1019":"Explainer","1141":"Explainee","1020":"Explainer","1142":"Explainee","1021":"Explainer","1143":"Explainee","1022":"Explainer","1144":"Explainee","1023":"Explainer","1145":"Explainee","1024":"Explainer","1146":"Explainee","1025":"Explainer","1147":"Explainee"}}

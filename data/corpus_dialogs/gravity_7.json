we've been talking about gravity","from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon,","pulling on each other in the conventional sense","of gravity being an attractive force,","to the Earth creating curves in space-time,","then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy","and space-time as the real universe","and gravitation is really just talking about","space-time in general, and here we are,","and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics.","Where would you take the exposition of gravity","from that point?"],"646":["Well, one thing is quantum mechanics.","Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory","in the history of science,","it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely.","Yet many people would still say we don't understand","even the basics of it."],"558":["So when we think about quantum mechanics,","we think about particles and their quantum charges","in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us.","They come in and they exchange a force carrier","and then they come out again,","so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering,","for instance, or something like that.","And the language that Einstein gave us is so different.","It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time.","And it's also unnecessary."],"647":["Yeah, for me, the beauty of the theory of gravity is","the way Einstein formulated it,","as a theory of geometry, of curved space and time.","I think, like you, that's one of the things","that really pulled me into it."],"559":["Is there really space-time","or are we just using unnecessary language","because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful?"],"648":["Well, I think there's really space-time","in the sense that it's a description that works really well,","so there has to be something right about it.","I mean, if we're gonna talk about","what's really, really underlying that","and we're gonna put quantum mechanics into the mix,","then there should be some","quantum mechanical wave function for space-time.","You should be able to take two different space-times","and add them together,","'cause one of the crazy things about quantum mechanics,","as you know, it's--"],"560":["To have the waves together."],"649":["Yeah, and in two states","and in two possible states of the world,","you can just literally put a plus sign between them","and that's a sensible state, that's a good state,","it makes sense."],"561":["So do you think there's some sense","in which we shouldn't be thinking","about individual universes, individual space-time,","so we should be thinking about","superpositions of space-times?"],"650":["Yeah, I think so.","I think if you were to go far enough back","in the history of the universe,","back to when it was very, very dense, very small,","and when quantum mechanics was certainly important,","then it must have been like that.","I mean, if we believe that","the dominant standard model of cosmology,","something had to produce the density perturbations,","the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars","and everything else in the world.","So there's a galaxy over there, let's say,","and not over there, so how did that happen?","Why is there a galaxy there and not there?","In the standard theory, as you know,","that was a quantum event, a random event.","And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there","'cause you flipped a coin,","it actually happened in both places.","There's gotta be a wave function","where in one branch of the wave function","there's a galaxy there and not there,","and on the other branch it's the opposite."],"562":["So when we're talking about","the multiverse or the Big Bang,","we are really talking about gravity ultimately,","and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation","which we know think of as a theory of space-time","has a quantum explanation,","has a quantum paradigm imposed on it","that will help us understand these things,","and we don't have that yet.","One of the things that I think is so amazing","is that the terrains in which we're going to understand","quantum gravity are very few.","It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know","that quantum and gravity both were called into action.","And there's black holes.","One of the most interesting discoveries","is of course Hawking's discovery,","kick-started a kind of crisis, right?","In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity","were so knocking heads.","It was one of the most beautiful examples."],"651":["Sure, yeah, it is a beautiful, beautiful idea.","So, first of all, to be totally clear, though,","we've never observed Hawking radiation,","which is what he predicted, directly.","I don't think very many people doubt that it's there,","but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically","that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon,","it's got a surface which is a point of no return.","If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have,","no matter how powerful the rocket you've got,","even if you beam a flashlight back behind you","in the direction you fall from,","nothing escapes, not even light.","It all gets sucked in and spaghettified","and destroyed at the singularity,","or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out.","But in quantum mechanics,","you can't really pin down","the location of something precisely.","If you try to pin down an electron","in a tiny circuit in a microchip,","sometimes you discover it's not actually there","and then your computer crashes."],"563":["This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality.","You can't precisely say where the electron is,","and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving."],"652":["Exactly, yeah, so when you get the blue screen of death,","that might be because of quantum mechanics."],"564":["Right."],"653":["You know, you try to pin something down","near a black hole, well, it's a surface,","it's got a particular radius for a round black hole,","and wanna say something is inside or outside,","well, you can't absolutely say that in quantum mechanics.","And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation,","which you can think of as pulling some of the energy","out of the black hole.","The black hole is formed out of some mass","and there's an energy in that.","If you think of pulling some energy out of that","and sending it off to infinity","in the form of particles being admitted.","And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum,","it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole,","but like an oven, the kind of radiation","that comes out of a cast iron."],"565":["This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe","actually is forced to radiate quantum particles","is pretty wild.","I think everyone understood","that it was a correct calculation,","but I don't think a lot of people","understood the implications,","that it meant something really terrible was happening.","Because this black hole,","which could have been made of who knows what,","is disappearing into these quantum particles","which, in some sense, have nothing to do","with the material that went in.","So do you think that's a big crisis?","The black hole evaporates, the information is lost?"],"654":["It's a crisis because of some of the details of it,","but I would say the way you just described,","I mean, if I build a big bonfire or an incinerator","and I throw an encyclopedia into it,","good luck reconstructing what was in that encyclopedia.","The information is lost for all practical purpose."],"566":["Practical purposes."],"655":["Yes."],"567":["So this is a huge crisis","'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong,","and as you described it,","it's the most accurately-tested paradigm","in the history of physics,","how could it be wrong, right?","Or the event horizon is letting information out","and violating one of the most","sacred principles of relativity."],"656":["One thing about quantum mechanics is that","any time you have a state of the world","and another state of the world,","you can literally add them together","and get a third possible state,","as crazy as that sounds.","And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity,","then we can't really talk about there being a black hole","or not a black hole,","or an event horizon or not an event horizon,","because we could always a state","that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't,","or has the event horizon","in a slightly different position, maybe,","and add them together.","So the existence or position of an event horizon","can't possibly be determined as a fact","any more than the position of an electron is determined.","So I think that's the loophole."],"568":["That's a nice way of looking at it.","So that you're not actually violating classical relativity","once you're in a regime where the wave function","has really peaked around a very well-defined stage."],"657":["That's right, and one of the most exciting developments","in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography,","and it's called holography because","a hologram is a two-dimensional surface","that creates a three-dimensional image.","It's got sort of 3D information built into it.","And this, in a fundamental way,","really has that 3D or higher dimensional information","built into it.","It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity","and more dimensions."],"569":["Yes, so one of the things I like to think of","with holography is that I can pack","a certain amount of information in a black hole.","I mean, you can literally think of it","as throwing things into it.","So let's say I have information in some volume","and I'm under the illusion","that I can just keep packing information in that volume,","as much as the volume will contain.","Eventually I'll make a black hole","and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information","I can pack into anything in the entire universe","is what I can pack on the area.","And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume,","maybe the whole world is just a hologram.","It's not a principle that only applies to black holes.","It's saying that,","if this theory of quantum gravity is correct,","then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion","and really the universe is two-dimensional.","That's crazy."],"658":["That's true."],"570":["[Janna laughs]"],"659":["And as practically speaking,","you mentioned before in our conversation","that it's really interesting","that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle","is a practical limit now in microchips.","If we make microchips much smaller than they already are,","even as they already are, it causes errors,","'cause you don't know that the electron's in.","If holography, if this limit on how much information","you can ever pack, if that ever become a limit,","as far as we know that's an absolute limit.","We started off with clay tablets,","not so much information per cubit centimeter or whatever.","Then we had written stuff that's getting better,","encyclopedias with thin paper that's even better, CDs."],"571":["A smaller and smaller space,","trying to pack it denser and denser,","until eventually we make a black hole."],"660":["Yeah, at some point you try to fill up","your encyclopedia with knowledge","and you get swallowed up by a black hole."],"572":["Right, exactly.","And the most knowledge you could ever have","would only be on a two-dimensional surface."],"661":["Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done.","So, you know, not likely","that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon."],"573":["Do you think it's possible","that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics","and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways","that we've been talking about so far,","like the Newtonian way and the space-time way,","that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions?","Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature.","Temperature is not a thing.","There is no single thing called temperature.","It's a macroscopic illusion","that comes from the collective behavior,","really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms.","And is it possible that the whole of gravity","is some kind of emergent illusion","from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?"],"662":["If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely,","that's for sure, that's what it's telling us.","Although which side is the illusion","and which side is the reality?","They're the same."],"574":["I mean, temperature is still great to talk about.","It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature.","I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats","and talk about temperature.","But if we look at it closer and closer and closer,","we realize there's not a thing in the world","that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated.","And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity","isolated from quantum mechanics."],"663":["Right, so I guess with the holographic description","we've got two sides, which are actually secretly the same.","On one side there's definitely no gravity.","On the other side, well,","it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means.","But the point is you can get it out,","it's equivalent to this theory."],"575":["So that's just like saying","there's the idea of a dual description.","It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary","between these two descriptions,","and so to belabor which one's real is silly.","It's like saying, is French or is English real?"],"664":["Yeah, an example I like to give is","if you take some extra dimensions","and you compactify them, let's say just one,","all that is, it's exactly prevalent","to whatever particles you had,","whatever fields you had in your original theory","before you added it,","you just added an infinite tower of new particles","with certain properties that are all easy to calculate.","For me, it's a question of which description","is most useful.","I mean, if you wanna say gravity is an illusion","and it's all quantum, that's great,","but then you fall down the stairs and bang your head."],"576":["[Janna laughs]"],"665":["It's sort of like there's a description","that works pretty well."],"577":["Yeah, you don't go to the doctor and say,","Heisenberg's uncertainty principle caused","a series of fluctuations."],"666":["Right, would you help me?","So there's so many open questions.","The fact that they are all these fundamental issues","that we really don't understand.","But, on the other hand, there's all these moving parts","that fit together so neatly.","There's definitely something that's working here.","But ultimately what is gonna emerge from that,","what structure is lying under it, we just don't know.","But I think the fact that there are","so many fundamental questions","that we just don't know the answer to,","that is an opportunity, that's exciting, it's great."],"578":["Thanks so much for coming.","It's really good to have you here."],"667":["Thank you very much, Janna, it was my pleasure."]},"turn_sentences":{"557":["So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics.","Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?"],"646":["Well, one thing is quantum mechanics.","Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely.","Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it."],"558":["So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us.","They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that.","And the language that Einstein gave us is so different.","It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time.","And it's also unnecessary."],"647":["Yeah, for me, the beauty of the theory of gravity is the way Einstein formulated it, as a theory of geometry, of curved space and time.","I think, like you, that's one of the things that really pulled me into it."],"559":["Is there really space-time or are we just using unnecessary language because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful?"],"648":["Well, I think there's really space-time in the sense that it's a description that works really well, so there has to be something right about it.","I mean, if we're gonna talk about what's really, really underlying that and we're gonna put quantum mechanics into the mix, then there should be some quantum mechanical wave function for space-time.","You should be able to take two different space-times and add them together, 'cause one of the crazy things about quantum mechanics, as you know, it's--"],"560":["To have the waves together."],"649":["Yeah, and in two states and in two possible states of the world, you can just literally put a plus sign between them and that's a sensible state, that's a good state, it makes sense."],"561":["So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?"],"650":["Yeah, I think so.","I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that.","I mean, if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology, something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and everything else in the world.","So there's a galaxy over there, let's say, and not over there, so how did that happen?","Why is there a galaxy there and not there?","In the standard theory, as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event.","And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there 'cause you flipped a coin, it actually happened in both places.","There's gotta be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there, and on the other branch it's the opposite."],"562":["So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet.","One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few.","It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action.","And there's black holes.","One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right?","In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads.","It was one of the most beautiful examples."],"651":["Sure, yeah, it is a beautiful, beautiful idea.","So, first of all, to be totally clear, though, we've never observed Hawking radiation, which is what he predicted, directly.","I don't think very many people doubt that it's there, but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon, it's got a surface which is a point of no return.","If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have, no matter how powerful the rocket you've got, even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fall from, nothing escapes, not even light.","It all gets sucked in and spaghettified and destroyed at the singularity, or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out.","But in quantum mechanics, you can't really pin down the location of something precisely.","If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit in a microchip, sometimes you discover it's not actually there and then your computer crashes."],"563":["This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality.","You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving."],"652":["Exactly, yeah, so when you get the blue screen of death, that might be because of quantum mechanics."],"564":["Right."],"653":["You know, you try to pin something down near a black hole, well, it's a surface, it's got a particular radius for a round black hole, and wanna say something is inside or outside, well, you can't absolutely say that in quantum mechanics.","And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation, which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole.","The black hole is formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that.","If you think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being admitted.","And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum, it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole, but like an oven, the kind of radiation that comes out of a cast iron."],"565":["This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe actually is forced to radiate quantum particles is pretty wild.","I think everyone understood that it was a correct calculation, but I don't think a lot of people understood the implications, that it meant something really terrible was happening.","Because this black hole, which could have been made of who knows what, is disappearing into these quantum particles which, in some sense, have nothing to do with the material that went in.","So do you think that's a big crisis?","The black hole evaporates, the information is lost?"],"654":["It's a crisis because of some of the details of it, but I would say the way you just described, I mean, if I build a big bonfire or an incinerator and I throw an encyclopedia into it, good luck reconstructing what was in that encyclopedia.","The information is lost for all practical purpose."],"566":["Practical purposes."],"655":["Yes."],"567":["So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right?","Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity."],"656":["One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds.","And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together.","So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined.","So I think that's the loophole."],"568":["That's a nice way of looking at it.","So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage."],"657":["That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image.","It's got sort of 3D information built into it.","And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it.","It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions."],"569":["Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole.","I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it.","So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain.","Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area.","And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram.","It's not a principle that only applies to black holes.","It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional.","That's crazy."],"658":["That's true."],"570":["[Janna laughs]"],"659":["And as practically speaking, you mentioned before in our conversation that it's really interesting that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a practical limit now in microchips.","If we make microchips much smaller than they already are, even as they already are, it causes errors, 'cause you don't know that the electron's in.","If holography, if this limit on how much information you can ever pack, if that ever become a limit, as far as we know that's an absolute limit.","We started off with clay tablets, not so much information per cubit centimeter or whatever.","Then we had written stuff that's getting better, encyclopedias with thin paper that's even better, CDs."],"571":["A smaller and smaller space, trying to pack it denser and denser, until eventually we make a black hole."],"660":["Yeah, at some point you try to fill up your encyclopedia with knowledge and you get swallowed up by a black hole."],"572":["Right, exactly.","And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface."],"661":["Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done.","So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon."],"573":["Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions?","Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature.","Temperature is not a thing.","There is no single thing called temperature.","It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms.","And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?"],"662":["If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us.","Although which side is the illusion and which side is the reality?","They're the same."],"574":["I mean, temperature is still great to talk about.","It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature.","I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature.","But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated.","And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics."],"663":["Right, so I guess with the holographic description we've got two sides, which are actually secretly the same.","On one side there's definitely no gravity.","On the other side, well, it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means.","But the point is you can get it out, it's equivalent to this theory."],"575":["So that's just like saying there's the idea of a dual description.","It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions, and so to belabor which one's real is silly.","It's like saying, is French or is English real?"],"664":["Yeah, an example I like to give is if you take some extra dimensions and you compactify them, let's say just one, all that is, it's exactly prevalent to whatever particles you had, whatever fields you had in your original theory before you added it, you just added an infinite tower of new particles with certain properties that are all easy to calculate.","For me, it's a question of which description is most useful.","I mean, if you wanna say gravity is an illusion and it's all quantum, that's great, but then you fall down the stairs and bang your head."],"576":["[Janna laughs]"],"665":["It's sort of like there's a description that works pretty well."],"577":["Yeah, you don't go to the doctor and say, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle caused a series of fluctuations."],"666":["Right, would you help me?","So there's so many open questions.","The fact that they are all these

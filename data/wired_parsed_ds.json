directly","and lower our use of intermediaries","like companies or banks maybe.","I think today everyone can leave understanding","something about blockchain at some level."],"1":["Do you know what we're gonna talk about today?","It's called blockchain."],"2":["That's a really good question.","It's actually a way that we can trade.","Do you know what trade is?"],"3":["When you give up most of what you want?","Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure.","What if I told you that this is the kind of technology","that I work on that means you could trade","with any kid all over the world?"],"4":["Yeah."],"5":["That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else","likes it more than you do.","So normally, when people trade, they have to go","to the store, or they have to know the person","so they can get what they asked for.","With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade,","but you don't need the store, and you don't even","necessarily need to know the other person."],"6":["Really."],"7":["[Bettina] So Ian, do you know what blockchain is?"],"8":["Have you ever traded or sold anything?"],"9":["That's amazing.","What made you decide to trade on eBay?"],"10":["So what if I told you that blockchain technology","is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing,","but it goes to you and I directly?","You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between."],"11":["And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen","in our society today, right?","We have a lot of banks."],"12":["We have a lot of companies that sort of help us","make sure that our trades happen,","but if we could guarantee the same trade","using technology as sort of a technological trust,","then we wouldn't really need","all those middlemen in between."],"13":["It's basically a network of computers","that all have the same history of transactions.","And so instead of sort of there being one company","with one database that holds all the information,","the same sort of list is held by all these different people.","Like, you could have it on your computer.","And then it gets validated by everyone,","and basically, that turns into the next part of the list.","So it's sort of constantly updating itself."],"14":["So it use cryptography, and that helps it basically","encode all of the transactions.","So you can't really see exactly what happened,","but you can know it happened because it's like a marker."],"15":["Yeah, exactly."],"16":["[Bettina] Exactly."],"17":["So it's kinda this like really big ledger","or accounting system for all sorts of things","that get traded, but instead of being owned","by one company, it's owned by everybody."],"18":["Yeah."],"19":["We're gonna talk about blockchain technology.","Have you heard of blockchain?"],"20":["When we were much smaller societies,","you and I could trade in our community pretty easily.","As the distance in our trade grew,","we ended up inventing institutions, right?","If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even,","these are just digital marketplaces and platforms","that help us facilitate an exchange of value.","But today, we actually have a technology","that allows us to trade one to one but at scale,","and it's called blockchain technology.","There is some kind of interface for it.","You could have an app, or you could use a computer","to do it, but instead of there being a company","in the middle that's helping you make that transaction,","it's a bunch of software code."],"21":["And so it's being run by all of these different computers","that have like a node.","So they're all running the same software","and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen."],"22":["In some cases, yeah, it is.","And a lot of people in the financial industry,","in particular, are looking at it from the banking side","of how do we use this technology to trade things","like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use","instead of today's currency.","A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin","because it's sort of in the news a lot,","and it's this new cryptocurrency.","And it's kind of exciting.","But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases","for blockchain that aren't around the currency side.","They're more around, how do you take any asset","and be able to trade that using this same technology."],"23":["So today, a lot of people are working on how to create","identity structures that leverage blockchains.","And one of the tools for doing that is being able","to cryptographically sign for a given attribute.","So your government could sign that you have a US passport","or a university could sign that you are","a currently enrolled student.","And you could then dole out that information","and control it yourself and be able to show people","those certifications on an as needed basis."],"24":["So today, we're gonna talk about blockchain technology."],"25":["[Bettina] Have you ever heard of blockchain?"],"26":["Yeah, that's exactly right.","And you can append it.","You can sort of add new information that's more current,","but you can't actually go erase anything."],"27":["For sure.","A lot of the assumptions won't hold true."],"28":["Same with, who are the actors?","It's not just people anymore.","It's machines."],"29":["We're gonna have to create entire new concepts","of how they do trade and how they work with us, too.","What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine","are gonna happen in the blockchain space?"],"30":["Yeah.","One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced","is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost.","But a lot of that actually comes from people","trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways","making themselves actually a pretty easy target."],"31":["Yeah.","To actually transition into the mainstream","and make it useful for average people to use,","we're going to need to make sure we have","a lot more education, a lot more standards","and probably work with a lot of enterprises","to create sort of a user experience around","this being a technology that is safe","and usable and understandable.","What is the current state of blockchain","in your understanding?","What's gonna have to happen next?"],"32":["Well, we have a lot of public blockchains.","Like we have Bitcoin.","We have the Ethereum network and XT,","but a lot of companies and consortiums","are getting together to build private blockchains,","so ones that are more closed off at first","and then may evolve into a public network","where people feel comfortable using it.","And some are also proof of concept out in the real world,","projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals","and in retail and lots of different fields","are starting experiments.","And we'll see in the next few years","how all of those interact and what we learn","about the best use cases for blockchain","and what it means for trade."],"33":["So tell me your version of a technical","definition of blockchain."],"34":["So it randomizes?"],"35":["Do you see it as defining a new discipline of kinds,","or where are we gonna see blockchain emerge","in the real world first?"],"36":["Sure, and people are working on that already."],"37":["A lot of people are seeing blockchain in the news","and maybe seeing a lot of sort of initial coin offerings","(laughs)","and sort of monetization opportunity around blockchain","and getting very excited about it.","And some of that excitement is real and should be,","you know, encouraged, but some of it is also hype.","How do you feel about the hype cycle","around blockchain today?"],"38":["And it also creates a problem, which is people","get a lot of excitement around it."],"39":["And then they're waiting for the world to change, right?"],"40":["Where is this technology?","Why haven't I seen any change yet?"],"41":["And it's because we've had a lot of PR,","a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully,","this is more like a science, right?"],"42":["It will develop.","It will take five years.","It will take 10 years.","That kind of time is necessary.","One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research","is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge.","We're gonna see artificial intelligence","continue to evolve.","We're gonna see connective devices","and this sort of growing internet of things","and machinery that can do a lot more","and have a wallet and transact on their own.","And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain","and other technologies are headed","is this interesting synergy that will help us","elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past","and cobbled together to create","that identifiable, verifiable trust."],"43":["[Bettina] Right."],"44":["Yeah."],"45":["So a barrier being sort of a rigidity in structures","that maybe don't accommodate real-life scenarios very well."],"46":["The system we have today is also broken.","(laughs)","Right?"],"47":["In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future.","Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very","high standard because machines are doing it.","It should be perfect.","There should be zero car deaths."],"48":["When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands,","millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today.","I think we're in a similar place.","We're going to see problems with this technology,","and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds","of standards that also have some flexibility.","But it's going to also be a version, a system,","that allows us to fix some of the things","that are broken today."],"49":["Blockchain may sound complicated,","but at it's core, it's just another tool","for humans and eventually robots and other kinds","of identities to trade at scale","and make that trade more decentralized.","And it's part of our future, so it's important","that people have these kinds of conversations","and start to learn about it."],"50":["What's blockchain?"],"51":["Mmm-hmm, it's when you take turns doing something.","It's when you give up most of what you want, right?"],"52":["Really?"],"53":["If I could trade with any kid, I would trade,","well, I would trade something I don't like so much."],"54":["Really?"],"55":["No."],"56":["Actually, I'm selling my computer on eBay right now."],"57":["Well, I mean, I've heard of it,","and I trust it a lot because they have","all of their guarantees, so I know that I'm gonna","get money and the person's gonna get what they want."],"58":["That's cool."],"59":["Yeah."],"60":["So how does it work?"],"61":["So like, how do you make sure that it's secure?"],"62":["So you could kind of like, I don't know,","say trade apples, but you would just","see like random letters for it?"],"63":["So you wouldn't be able to track it, I guess?"],"64":["That's cool."],"65":["That's cool."],"66":["I've heard of the words blockchain,","but I'm not sure I know what it is."],"67":["Okay."],"68":["I mean, I would assume this technology","is taking away business or activity from these middlemen."],"69":["Is there a mechanism for verifying that person A","is a legitimate seller or producer of the item?"],"70":["Okay."],"71":["I have.","Whenever we have a transaction, and let's say","I buy something from you, this information gets logged.","And it gets verified by a third person or third party.","And then if like all this information verified","and it all matches, right, the transaction goes through","without any intermediary basically, right?","It gets stored, and when you make further transactions,","this information is ready, embedded.","It's in the ledger."],"72":["Absolutely.","The way the technology's changing,","nothing's gonna be like it used to be.","And there's no like firm, and then the buyer","and the seller, it basically, we'll have","to rewrite a lot of rules in economics as well."],"73":["Absolutely."],"74":["[Valentinas] Absolutely."],"75":["So at least when we talk about Bitcoin,","there are some trust issues and some hacks.","So there's obviously a need to work on trust","and feeling that it's a safe technology."],"76":["Absolutely, so education will be a big part","before we actually can use the technology in a wide sense.","Right?"],"77":["The current state is in the research state,","and it's being developed to be applied in many, many areas.","It must be used almost everywhere","to where we won't even imagine how we lived without it.","But I'm not sure where it's going to go.","I mean, no one really knows, right."],"78":["A technical definition of blockchain","is that it is a persistent, transparent,","public, append-only ledger.","So it is a system that you can add data to","and not change previous data within it.","It does this through a mechanism for creating consensus","between scattered, or distributed, parties","that do not need to trust each other","but just need to trust the mechanism","by which their consensus is arrived at.","In the case of blockchain, it relies on some form","of challenge such that no one actor on the network","is able to solve this challenge consistently","more than everyone else on the network."],"79":["Yes, it randomizes the process and, in theory,","ensures that no one can force the blockchain to accept","a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree","with, one that relies on a mechanism","for a peer to peer network that can maintain updates","to the ledger and then verify those updates","in such a way that it is impossible to defraud","and impossible to alter after the fact."],"80":["I mean, just like an example, one thing that I think","about a lot in terms of possible blockchain","applications is electricity, right.","The next generation of distributed smart grid","technology effectively--"],"81":["Yeah, yeah, exactly.","And it's this very fruitful area of research,","and you can find yourself looking like 20 years out, right,","where you have an enormous number of electric cars.","You have all of these batteries.","That's essentially a distributed","peak load power grid, right.","Like, the cars are getting plugged in","and unplugged at different times.","If you have a mechanism that's able to automatically","and autonomously be distributing power","based on batteries that are scattered throughout","the grid that are being used for other purposes.","Their owners don't even necessarily need to be aware.","I mean, to have something that looks like a much more","viable society that still has a lot of electricity needs","but is able to base that much more on renewables,","is able to make up the difference during peak load periods","or during differences in weather, that is able to have","power much closer to where it is needed","rather than having to be distributed over great distances.","It's like, that's something that would be","an enormously hard problem to solve.","And it's not that the blockchain makes it easy,","but it makes it possible."],"82":["I'm glad you mentioned initial coin offerings","because for me, those really exemplify","the sort of problem that we're having at this exact moment.","They are an idea with enormous potential","significance down the road.","However, the promise of the initial coin offering","has been kind of hijacked into this string","of like basically pump and dump scams","or sort of desperate gold rush schemes.","The faster that we can shift from this fantasy","that it is going to make you rich in a sort of,","you know, 1920s tulip bubble kind of way,","is the sooner that we can get into people,","honestly, and I mean this like with all the hope","in the world, people being disappointed in blockchain.","It's like, oh, I didn't get rich.","It's just being used now to make it easier","to transact goods and services safely across borders.","This isn't exciting at all.","And then we'll see that become part","of the everyday infrastructure of the world","in a way that I think will be very significant.","But I think it is now, almost every aspect of it","that's connected with the concept of money","is wildly over-hyped, and--"],"83":["[Finn] Yes."],"84":["[Finn] Yeah, yeah."],"85":["(laughs) Yes, yes, yes."],"86":["Yes."],"87":["Yes, and one of the most interesting ideas to me","that came out of the currency side of the blockchain","project was the notion around like coloring coins, right,","assign properties to a particular coin,","and in particular to assign those properties in ways","that would allow you to do things like bring","in the graph of previous transactions."],"88":["You know, there's sort of an obvious application for this,","which is something that would look a little bit like","an extreme version of like a boycott divestment","and sanctions kind of approach, right,","a model where it's sort of a like I will not touch money.","My wallet will automatically not touch money","that has been exchanged with the following","as a sort of very extreme way of cutting those things out.","But there's also ways in which, I think, that could be","applied to clearing out the entire logistics process","of many kinds of bad actors.","Trying to make a supply chain better, in some ways,","relies a lot on whose version of better that is","and exactly kind of what gets qualified","but also how that is quantified within say","some kind of like smart contract system.","There's multiple ways that I can see this backfiring.","One is the ways in which that is implemented,","for example, leaving certain kinds","of bad behavior untouched or unanalyzed.","Or one that feels even more dire to me in some ways","is creating an extremely inflexible, like 'cause human","contracts, legal contracts, are actually very flexible.","There's a lot of kind of room","to renegotiate. There's lots of conditions."],"89":["But we already have real world versions","of some of these nightmare scenarios","where like your kid has a medical emergency","and you can't unlock your car because you're two days","behind on payments for it, and so the car system","will no longer respond to the app mechanism","that you're supposed to be able to use to drive it."],"90":["As you and I have been talking, one of the things","that keeps coming up is that we tend to hold novel","technologies to an unrealistically high standard","in terms of what they are supposed to deliver","rather than comparing them to actually existing systems","where we can begin to see the possibility","that even like a slight incremental improvement","would still be an enormous gain."],"91":["Yes."],"92":["(laughs) Yeah."],"93":["Hello everybody.","My name is Jacob Collier and I'm a musician.","I've been challenged today to explain one simple concept","in five levels of increasing complexity.","My topic, harmony.","I'm positive that everybody can leave this video","with some understanding at some level."],"94":["Bodhi, how's it going?"],"95":["Cool.","So do you know what harmony is?"],"96":["Yeah, that's 100% correct.","Have you ever heard a song called Amazing Grace?"],"97":["It's a good one.","The melody on its own just goes.","(hums Amazing Grace)","That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right?","And no one really knows how it feels.","(plays and hums Amazing Grace)","So which one did you prefer?"],"98":["[Jacob] Awesome.","And why did you prefer that one?"],"99":["Yeah, ah, that's great.","I can decide how I want this melody to feel","and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is.","That's what musical harmony is.","Does that make sense?"],"100":["You're the best."],"101":["Have you ever heard of harmony?"],"102":["Okay, so what do you think harmony is?"],"103":["I like it.","That's absolutely correct."],"104":["Harmony is about injecting melody with emotion","so that ultimately, you leave home and you return home","and you've learned something along the way."],"105":["So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad.","A triad is a three-part harmony, basically.","(keyboard harmonic tone)","So that's a triad.","So this triad's called C major."],"106":["So have you ever heard of this idea","of like, major chords and minor chords?"],"107":["So this is C major, yeah?","(keyboard music)","And then this is C minor.","So the feelings are different, right?"],"108":["[Jacob] Yeah, this one's dark and spooky."],"109":["And how does this one","make you feel though?"],"110":["Yeah, I like that, yeah."],"111":["So in Amazing Grace, you start with F.","You know, if I go","(melodic humming)","\u266a How sweet the sound \u266a","(scat singing)","(laughs)","Where am I right now?","I don't know where I am.","(scat singing)","And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord","make sense."],"112":["So I might go","(hums Amazing Grace)"],"113":["(mumbles) thanks."],"114":["Oh, cheers (mumbles)."],"115":["My job as a harmonizer is to find","that narrative and make it make sense."],"116":["Cool."],"117":["Right."],"118":["Amazing, that's great."],"119":["Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right?","And so as with any language,","the more words you're capable of speaking","in a language, the more you can say.","All right, so in harmony, this might be","how many notes you can think to add to a chord","to make it feel a different way.","Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?"],"120":["Okay, that's great.","On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us","feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of,","(keyboard music)","these really bright sounds.","And the other side is a lot more to do","with the darkness of a key center.","So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking","a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out."],"121":["What notes would you suggest I add?"],"122":["F is a great one.","Yeah, and if we keep going in that direction?"],"123":["Yeah."],"124":["You got it.","Ooh! Yeah?","Yeah, yeah. So this is really,","this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know?","Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace.","Let's play it in its simplest form."],"125":["All right, so we're gonna start in F, right?","Yeah. So say.","\u266a I once \u266a","F, yeah.","(Amazing Grace)","B-flat, yeah.","F.","C.","F.","So we're home."],"126":["Nice, okay cool.","Lets try one more version where we add some colors.","Alright so lets visit the B flat,","with a bit more imagination."],"127":["Just to see how things feel. Yeah.","All right, lets do it.","(both playing Amazing Grace)","So it's F major seven, but its over A.","Which is F seven over A.","(both playing)","B flat major seven with an A and a G in it.","F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah.","(laughter)","D minor seven with a G in it.","C softs, or minor, nice.","B flat major.","G seven, F sharp major seven.","Home, yeah!","I like that.","So what harmony does is just gives us","even more tools to tell those stories.","Cool, yeah. Nice, man."],"128":["One nice emotional device when it come to harmony","is just thinking about how to arrive somewhere.","You know, it can be so sparse, it can be so rich,","and it can be really emotional.","So this idea of the overtone and the undertone","in the harmonic series, how much do you know about this?"],"129":["Right."],"130":["Yeah.","The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature.","So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example.","Okay.","You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the,","(hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine.","And then tones get increasingly small.","Beneath that note, you have the undertone series,","which essentially is like a reflection of something.","In the same way that when a tree grows in nature,","you have the branches which grow upwards and","the roots which go downwards.","So it's quite a nice thing to thing about,","this being the key center, the floor, the ground,","and then these two different directions","of ways in which it can express itself,","and the differences in the sensations with that.","Lots of the time I think when it comes to","reharmonization or harmonization,","people think that the solution to the problems","come when we add more notes."],"131":["I think that people forget that you can work","with the notes you already have by just rearranging them,","just the simple idea of inversion,","inversion of the simple triad, of F major.","\u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a","\u266a Was blind \u266a","\u266a But now I see \u266a","Now how home do I want to go here, you know?","Is there another verse to come?"],"132":["Because I can delay the gratification of going home.","First of all, just by using inversions,","even before we add the notes to the chord.","One thing that I was very joyful to discover","is that every single melody note","works with every single base note."],"133":["Yeah. so this is the note F."],"134":["F major, F minor, D flat major seven","G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven,","G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11.","And then, G seven with a flat 13"],"135":["That's it! (laughs)","A flat soft, A flat major seven.","A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11.","Essentially, what that demonstrates is that","every note and every base note are compatible.","So once we realize this its like, that's great!","Now what should we do?","What, how, what should we, what should we,","how, what am I supposed to do?","What to do, right.","And sometimes the paralyzing thing","when it comes to arranging, there are too many options,","too many things are possible.","So that's when it becomes super, super important","to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally."],"136":["So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony","would be this idea of polarity, you know,","between the overtone series and the undertone series,","or you know, the one side and the other side.","The perfect and the play goal.","The feeling of a minor perfect--","(keyboard music)","Resolving, it's so moving, you know?","And it's a good alternative to something like,","(keyboard music)"],"137":["Right."],"138":["Exactly, yeah.","No, for sure.","And, you know, F major can be something you arrive in from,","if you arrive in F major from D flat,","then it's like the sun's come up."],"139":["But if you arrive in F major from A major,","then it's like the sun's gone in."],"140":["So, there's a lot about context, I think.","Once you have a language, it's about using it","and applying it in those emotional ways.","I think that's what makes the difference."],"141":["A lot of people will see you as somebody","who's drank in harmony their whole life.","They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony.","How do you make the choices, there's so much","that's possible when you know stuff.","How do you have the courage to make a choice?"],"142":["Yeah, yeah, yeah.","I find it fascinating in music to think about,","you know, say I arrive in a place,","if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major.","And there's something you once taught me.","You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd."],"143":["And there's that chord.","It's not a Dennerman chord,","but it functions as a dominant chord.","But it doesn't matter, because you're still going","to the place you're going to."],"144":["It's something like, um...","(keyboard music)"],"145":["Yeah.","So this chord being, like a major seven","with a sharp five, and a natural,","like, there's no dominant thing."],"146":["But at that moment, I'm coming from here,","and I wanna forge some, some solution.","I get myself in a situation.","(keyboard music)"],"147":["That haunted me for days."],"148":["'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think","to use that chord in that situation.","And there it was!","And, you know, if you read the rule book,","it's, that not in it."],"149":["Chris Anderson, yeah, yeah."],"150":["Oh yeah."],"151":["Exactly right, it gets gnarly right?"],"152":["Yeah.","But if you verse that correctly, then you're safe."],"153":["You can get away with it."],"154":["Yeah. Oh yeah.","(keyboard music)"],"155":["Yeah."],"156":["Yeah."],"157":["Right, right, right."],"158":["Something like that.","And that's not 'cause like emotionally,","it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here.","But, if the base note is the same,","it's like this inevitability about it,","it's like I was there all along."],"159":["Yeah, yeah.","It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing","has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious.","I love thinking about these things emotionally,","just because that's a feeling,","I know that feeling in my life."],"160":["(Jacob) No."],"161":["Yeah.","Was there ever a point in your life","when you were younger where you felt like you had","consistently fell back into the same habits?"],"162":["I don't want to play this same thing again."],"163":["So you thought he said butter."],"164":["And he said bottom.","But you thought he said butter."],"165":["Wow."],"166":["Wow."],"167":["That's amazing."],"168":["I've been using this tune Amazing Grace."],"169":["And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to.","And we could talk about some stuff.","I've been doing it in F.","(keyboards playing Amazing Grace)","(laughing)","Thanks Herbie, that was a trip."],"170":["Good."],"171":["It's when people sing together and it sounds nice."],"172":["No."],"173":["The second one."],"174":["Because it sounds better."],"175":["Mm-hmm."],"176":["Thank you!"],"177":["Yes."],"178":["I think basically it's like, one person has the lower","voice and then like, girl usually has the higher voice","and then they blend it together."],"179":["Okay."],"180":["Yeah."],"181":["Okay."],"182":["Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."],"183":["Yeah, feels like dark and spooky."],"184":["Haunted house."],"185":["Happy.

(laughs)","The other thing that I like, that we both do on occasion,","is to be on the chord we want to arrive at","with the bottom part of our structure.","And the chord before the arrival

that?"],"237":["Butter notes, right."],"238":["Yeah."],"239":["And so, I started thinking,","oh great, what could butter be?","What is butter?","Then I started thinking, what are the obvious notes?","For example in a chord.","The obvious notes are the third and the seventh.","So I said, maybe if I leave those out.","It changed everything for me, from that moment on.","I got more applause

thank you."],"244":["My name's Aric Prather and I'm a sleep scientist at UCSF.","I study the causes and consequences of insufficient sleep,","and I also carry out interventions to improve sleep","among people with insomnia.","Today, I've been challenged to explain the topic of sleep","at five different levels.","Everybody knows a little bit about","what is happening when they sleep,","but I think they'll be surprised","that there's a lot of science in there."],"245":["Hey Christopher.","And how old are you?"],"246":["What grade is that?"],"247":["You think fifth?","What is your favorite subject?"],"248":["Well that's awesome,","because we're going to be talking about science today."],"249":["And you know what we're going to be talking about?"],"250":["Sleep."],"251":["Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it.","Because you know what sleep does for you?"],"252":["[laughs] That's exactly right.","It kinda is like recharging your battery, right?","And sleep is so critical for so many parts","of our body and our mind, right?","It plays a really important way that we learn,","and it helps us kind of recover from the day before.","It affects our immune system and our metabolism,","all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy."],"253":["So today, we're going to talk about some animals","and how they sleep.","So here's the first one.","What's that?"],"254":["Have you ever seen a giraffe in person?"],"255":["They're pretty cool, right?"],"256":["And so what's really cool about this is that","giraffes need to sleep like everybody else,","and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over","and it gets down on its legs","and it kind of becomes this ball,","but what's crazy about the whole thing","is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day.","30 minutes!","Because it can't waste any more time,","because it can't be vulnerable for any longer.","It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing.","It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive","and still get all the restoration it needs","under such a short period of time."],"257":["So we think it works the same way,","but maybe just like more efficiently.","And so we're still really learning about how this works.","Sleep science itself is kind of a new field."],"258":["And how did you feel?"],"259":["Really tired.","Do you think you were a little crankier than usual?","Yeah.","That's actually really interesting,","because what happens is","humans and everything needs to sleep eventually,","and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right?","What do you think happens if you don't sleep?"],"260":["Excellent.","So now I want to tell you about another animal","and how they sleep, okay?","So we have this one.","What's that?"],"261":["A hippopotamus.","They have a different challenge.","They sleep underwater."],"262":["Right, right!","So how do they do it?","In the area that they live in,","they need to stay cool, right?","And so they spend a lot of time in the water,","and so then as a consequence,","they need to sleep in the water,","but how do they do it?","So it's really fascinating.","What they do is while they're sleeping,","they actually float back up to the surface and breathe","without waking up.","They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles","but still able to breathe,","because their body has adapted in a way","that they can still get the oxygen that they need.","It's a really amazing thing.","What do you think?"],"263":["Would it be cool to have that power?"],"264":["So now I want to talk about our last animal,","and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all.","Okay, so what's this?"],"265":["A dolphin!","Yes.","So dolphins, kind of like hippos,","have to sleep in the water, okay?","But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe.","Dolphins breathe air.","They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right?","And for an animal like that,","it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep","but also still survive, right?","You know how dolphins sleep?"],"266":["One half of their brain at a time.","So half of their brain goes to sleep,","and the other half stays awake,","so that they can continue to breathe and swim,","and they do it in this four hours a time,","so like their right part of their brain sleeps,","they're able to go up to the surface and breathe.","Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours,","and it goes back and forth, back and forth,","so they can kind of maintain alertness,","still breathe, and survive.","Is that amazing or what?"],"267":["So what'd you learn today?"],"268":["What is important about sleeping?"],"269":["Hey, I'm Aric."],"270":["And how old are you, Dwayne?"],"271":["Okay, and where do you go to school?"],"272":["Excellent, and what's your favorite subject?"],"273":["That's a serious science."],"274":["And good news, we're talking about science today."],"275":["In fact, we're talking about sleep."],"276":["And sleep science.","Do you sleep?"],"277":["You try, we all gotta try.","You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of,","you know, it's a biological process","that happens in your brain.","It's really important for your body,","but it's a lot more complex than that.","Sleep is made up of different parts.","You know, when you think about sleep,","what do you think about?"],"278":["But being off is not just being off.","There's lots of things that are happening.","We're gonna kind of talk","about those different pieces of sleep."],"279":["So our sleep is made up of different types, okay?","The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep,","or non-REM, okay?","Or NREM.","And then the other one, which might not be a surprise,","is called REM.","Rapid eye movement sleep.","And those are the two main types of sleep that happen.","The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist","is that we'll actually bring people into the lab","where they can do this at home,","where we put electrodes on their scalp","while they're sleeping,","and that allows us to measure the brain activity","that's going on during the night."],"280":["When we measure all of that, we're able to see","how much time someone's asleep,","and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night.","You know, we're also really interested","in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets","and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets,","because each part of those types of sleep","do different things for the body.","And so it's important to get both of those.","And so within non-REM sleep,","there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3.","So not particularly clever in our naming,","but that's how we know what stages they are.","And what they do is it moves","from lightest to deepest sleep, okay?","N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep,","kind of in and out of sleeping.","Then you go into N-2,","which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep.","And it's more this kind of light sleep,","but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep,","and that's N-3.","And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave,","we see these big slow waves,","and it's called slow wave sleep.","And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep,","though it can vary on a day to day."],"281":["Okay?","When do you think you experience the most REM?"],"282":["You know, some of that is totally accurate,","that like when your brain's more engaged","by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy","or things that stress you out","or any of those types of things,","it's harder to get to sleep","and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep.","Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep,","happens in the second half of the night."],"283":["Okay?","So we wake up a lot during the night,","and we just don't remember it.","And you'll go back down into deep sleep,","and then up again into REM,","you know, in kinda these cycles."],"284":["Do you ever take naps?"],"285":["Okay.","How long are the naps that you take?"],"286":["One to six hours?","That's a long nap."],"287":["Okay.","Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes.","When people drop into deep sleep,","and then they're woken up out of a nap,","most people report that they feel way worse","than they did before they took the nap,","and that's because you've been in deep sleep,","and it's this term called sleep inertia.","So what are the stages of sleep?"],"288":["I want to know if you agree,","sleep is the coolest thing you've ever heard of."],"289":["So tell me, where are you in school?","What do you study?"],"290":["So pretty science-y."],"291":["Excellent, because today for this level,","we're talking about sleep."],"292":["How much sleep do you get, typically?"],"293":["10 hours?"],"294":["Wow."],"295":["And so, how much do you think you need?"],"296":["It turns out, for people that are","between the ages of 18 and 65,","the agreed upon amount of sleep","that people should get is between seven and nine hours,","and it's really at least seven hours per night,","to maintain optimal health as an adult.","So at least seven hours.","When we look at across all of the data that is available","on like sleep and health,","and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things,","the largest risk is when people get five hours or less.","What do you think is responsible for driving","how much sleep you need, and things like that?"],"297":["Right.","You can do part of this level,","and you can do the other part, clearly.","Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome,","because I think that everyone should know more about sleep.","And so the way that we think about what drives sleep","are two independent but related processes","and so they have kind of lame names.","Process S and process C,","and what you've kind of described is process C,","and that's the master clock, right?","And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms","like all over your body, all your cells,","and all those kind of things.","It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland,","and melatonin comes online under darkness,","so when the sun goes down, your brain knows","okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep,","and so you start releasing melatonin,","which really kind of sets the table for sleeping."],"298":["Yeah, no, that's a really great question,","and the same is true in places where","the sun never goes down during the summer,","and when it's dark all the time during the winter,","and it turns out light isn't the only thing","that kind of gates your circadian rhythm.","But I think the thing that's really important,","again there are two processes,","that the other one is the S process,","and that one's just kind of","a really important driver of sleep.","One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive.","Kind of the longer you're awake,","the sleepier you get.","You stay up, you get sleepy.","Time goes by, you get sleepier.","Time goes by, you get sleepier.","But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle","for how sleep is regulated,","and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay?","So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat.","You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness.","But then as you kind of go throughout the day,","it kind of fills up, so you use your energy,","it gets filled up.","And then it gets filled up more","as you get towards nighttime, right?","And then when it's at this optimal amount","is when you kind of go to sleep","and let out all of the sleepiness again.","And this is really what underlies","why napping can also be bad for you.","So napping's not inherently bad,","but if you actually let out some of this air during the day,","it's going to take longer for the balloon","to get bigger, right, I see","to where you feel sleepy, right?"],"299":["Right."],"300":["What did you learn about sleep today?"],"301":["Hi, I'm Aric."],"302":["Thank you for joining us.","What do you do?","Where are you at in school?"],"303":["Congratulations."],"304":["So a lot of brain stuff."],"305":["Great."],"306":["So that's good, because that's why you're here,","and so we're talking about sleep today,","and really about kind of what is the brain machinery","through which we go through consciousness","to unconsciousness and that transition."],"307":["Okay.","The best way to think about this transition","is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay?","So this term comes from engineering,","and the idea is that in sleep,","you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience.","Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep,","but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right?","So it seems like it's this flip flop between","the arousal system and the sleep promoting system,","and it's certainly regulated,","and we'll get a little bit into that,","but they're certainly kind of made up","of two reciprocally inhibitory processes.","Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system.","It originates in the brain stem,","and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this,","and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons,","that go up to the thalamus","and then it projections into the fore brain,","and then there's the ventral arm,","and this is comprised of a whole bunch","of different types of neurons,","so there are monominergic,","so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons","that come from the periaqueductal gray,","serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei,","histaminergic neurons that come","from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus,","and then noradrenergic neurons","from the locus coeruleus,","and so all of those are kind of working in tandem","to kind of drive wake within the brain.","So if we just think about drugs that are available","inducing wakefulness, we can certainly,","kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right?","So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling,","and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug","for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness","that maintains alertness throughout the day."],"308":["For the role that they play","with respect to the sleep-wake system","is really kind of amping up the wake system, right?","And so certainly that has like down stream consequences","for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch","is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction,","and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep","to get it pushed back to sleep."],"309":["And do we know much about why,","or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected?","You know, if you take amphetamines,","is it then when you go to sleep,","that you're not able to transition","through each of the sleep periods,","or is that less clear?"],"310":["You know, so I think","that's less clear.","In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea","of this wake-sleep system,","we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint","to this wake arousal system, and so","the primary nucleus region","is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus,","also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs","that release GABA and galanin,","which work in an inhibitory way","on kind of the wake promoting ones.","And so, it's kind of this delicate balance","of these two systems that are ongoing.","In your cognitive neuro-science training, right,","it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused","in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum,","and one thing that I'm interested in","is you bring a participant into the study,","have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep?","Have you asked them about their sleep?"],"311":["You know, what we do in our studies,","is we actually track people, for say a week,","and they have to get in within this range of amount of sleep","and then it has to be both amount of sleep","and how stable it is.","That variability can kind of impact it","and certainly might have an impact on the machinery","that's happening in the brain."],"312":["Yeah.","So what did you learn about sleep today?"],"313":["So now we have sleep on your brain.","That was all I wanted to hear."],"314":["Good to see you again, Yue."],"315":["Really glad that you could join us.","So we've been talking about sleep today,","various levels of complexity.","But now with you, I really want to talk about","what do we know about sleep and the aging brain.","Can you tell me a little bit about","some of the work that you've been doing in that area?"],"316":["So how strong is the link?"],"317":["So it's interesting, so I also saw","that there was also a recent meta-analysis","around sleep disturbances and dementia risk,","and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people","in this meta-analysis,","and they followed them around for 10 years,","and you know, when they pulled all the samples together,","they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk","for developing all caused dementia,","so it sounds like both sleep apnea","and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally","are associated with increased risk for dementia.","When I think about that, I think about how","sleep lives in the brain,","these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain,","and so what do we know about the causality of this?","Could it be that individuals","who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's,","have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?"],"318":["So within dementia risk in particular,","Alzheimer's for instance,","there are kind of two clear features","that seem to be part of the pathology, right?","So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain,","and then there's kind of these tangles,","this tauopathies, right?","And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related","to the tauopathies.","What about kind of beta-amyloid?"],"319":["Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece,","but I think perhaps the most exciting thing","that happened in the sleep field,","at least in my view,","has been understanding the role of sleep","and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain.","This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain,","it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates","as we kind of use energy,","and you know it's kind of a waste product,","and the idea that if you don't clear it out,","that it's going to build up and accumulate."],"320":["I'm excited about the future of sleep medicine.","I think there are incredible innovations that are happening","in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand","what are the clear biological processes","that underly some of these things","as they relate to disease risk,","and what is the true function of sleep,","kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?"],"321":["So this was certainly a challenge today.","Everyone knew a little bit about sleep,","and I think that's great,","because sleep is incredibly important,","but there was also a lot of misinformation","around kind of how sleep works,","and people doing sleep behaviors","that may not be the most adaptive for them.","We're still uncovering new things every day","about how sleep works, but despite that,","all of us know that sleep is fundamental to our health,","and so I'm excited for sleep to kind of raise its profile","among other health behaviors","and get the investment and care that it needs."],"322":["Nice to meet you, my name's Christopher."],"323":["I'm ten."],"324":["I think fifth."],"325":["Math and

really any of the N's at all, really,","if you are on technology right before you sleep.","And also if there's too much light,","or if you're listening to music while you're asleep","or anything like that,","you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?"],"360":["Oh."],"361":["Oh wow."],"362":["I do."],"363":["Anywhere from between one to six hours."],"364":["It is a long nap."],"365":["So N-1 being like light sleep,","still a lot of brain activity going on.","I can imagine that happens right after you fall asleep.","Asleep.","And then N-2 being light, moderate activity in your brain,","still sleep, but still kind of consciously aware,","and N-3 being the deepest form of sleep."],"366":["It really is.","[laughs]","Right now, it definitely is","the coolest thing I've ever heard of."],"367":["I'm a fourth year Chemistry student at USF."],"368":["Yes, pretty science-y."],"369":["Great."],"370":["During the summer?","Like 10 hours."],"371":["And during the school year, maybe five?"],"372":["Yeah."],"373":["I mean, I've read that six is ideal","for people in my age range."],"374":["I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated","by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus","sending signals to the pineal gland","to which kind of secretes melatonin,","which tells us when it's time to go to sleep."],"375":["I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days.","We have early sunrises, late sunsets.","Does that signify less sleep,","because we have a shorter amount of time","for melatonin to be released?"],"376":["I learned about the two processes,","process S and process C.","I learned about the circadian rhythm,","and it doesn't only rely on melatonin,","but it also relies on your eating","and a whole bunch of other factors","that affect your circadian rhythm."],"377":["Mave."],"378":["So I'm at UC Berkeley, I'm a psychology student","studying cognitive neuro-science","and I just started my third year."],"379":["Thank you."],"380":["A lot of brain stuff."],"381":["I'm biased because I study one of the other","sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum."],"382":["Great."],"383":["In terms of the dopamine,","if you're taking amphetamines,","that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness,","but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep?","How reliable are those kinds of interventions?"],"384":["Well in most studies, probably it is advised","for your participants before they come in","to get a good night's sleep,","so those would be recommendations that you would lay out,","you know, in communication with the participant,","before they come in."],"385":["I often think that people, many people think","that they can get by on very little sleep","where the less than average amount of sleep,","from what I know from the research,","you know if you actually test those people","on different batteries of cognitive tasks,","you often find that their performance is slightly worse","than they had anticipated."],"386":["I guess I learned a system that is,","you know, very heavily regulated and influenced","by some of these older conserved","sub-cortical systems in the brain,","and that there's, as you called it,","like a flip flop function between wakefulness and sleep","that's regulated by these specific dopaminergic,","neurogenergic, like neurotransmitters,","that manifest in different sub-cortical parts of the brain."],"387":["Yes, good to see you."],"388":["So I'm a epidemiologist,","so we do a lot of work","on the epidemiology of sleep","and development of neurodegenerative diseases","including both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease,","so ADMPD.","We mainly work on population studies.","We work on thousands and even millions of population,","and we use statistical modeling to find out","the association between different sleep disturbances","and also genetics related to sleep disturbances","and link that to their risk of developing ADMPD."],"389":["Our study has found really strong associations","looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea.","We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that","those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26,","which means that those who have sleep apnea","have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's","compared to those without sleep apnea."],"390":["Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating","is all these bio-directional relationships","that's being identified in animal studies especially,","showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on","in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage","of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD,","they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities","in this mouse."],"391":["Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD,","including those expressing","human mutant amyloid precursor protein,","APP type or both,","so that's kind of showing the sleep changes","in both of these pathologies."],"392":["So the thing I'm most excited about sleep research","is, I think, first of all,","this complexity of the daytime\/nighttime sleep,","what sleep is really doing to our body and to our brain,","and then is really from the epidemiologic","or public health perspective,","how we can best use sleep as a tool for the detection","and prevention of neurodegeneration in the long-term."],"393":["Hi, I'm George Tulevski, and I'm a research scientist","at IBM TJ Watson Research Center.","Today I've been challenged to teach one concept","in five levels of increasing complexity.","And my topic is nanotechnology.","Nanotechnology is a study of objects in the nanoscale","between 1 and 100 nanometers in size.","And it turns out that objects in this size scale","have really interesting properties","that differ from objects at a macroscopic scale.","Our task is nanotechnologists","is to understand these materials,","understand their properties,","and then try to build new technologies","based on these properties.","At the end of the day, my hope","is that you'll understand nanotechnology at some level."],"394":["Hi, are you Bella?"],"395":["Bella, I'm George, nice to meet you."],"396":["I'm a research scientist.","Do you like science?"],"397":["I wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science","called nanotechnology.","Have you ever heard of this word before?"],"398":["Nano is kind of a funny word, right?","It's a word that's used before another word,","and it means one billion.","What's the smallest object you can think of?"],"399":["A baby ant?","Very good.","So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you.","And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000,","I get a millimeter. So milli just means 1000.","There's all these little lines on the ruler.","And each of those little lines is one millimeter.","So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters.","So even the thing, that's the smallest thing","you can think of, it's a million times bigger","than a nanometer.","Tiny, tiny, tiny."],"400":["If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines,","the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer.","So that's really all it is. It's just a measure of size.","But it's really, really, really tiny,","smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes.","The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists,","we care about things that are that small,","is because there are objects called atoms.","Have you ever heard of atoms before?"],"401":["That was a perfect explanation.","But what if I told you that scientists","invented a special type of microscope","that not only lets you see atoms,","but also lets you move them around","and build things with them.","Would you think that would be pretty cool?"],"402":["So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope.","And not only can you see the atoms,","but you can move them around.","Atoms are kind of sticky.","You can actually build things using this instrument","with actual individual atoms.","So if I gave you that machine,","would you want to make something?","Would you want to look at something very carefully?"],"403":["You are definitely a second grader! [laughing]","My daughter would probably answer the exact same way.","A unicorn would be awesome."],"404":["I study it because objects that are that small","have really interesting properties.","They behave completely different than objects that are big.","And because of that,","we can build really cool things with them.","Like really fast computers, for example,","or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells.","And a lot of nanotechnology","is kind of like playing with Legos.","You take these small objects","and you put them together to build something new.","Something interesting that no one's built before.","It's like Legos for scientists."],"405":["So how old are you?"],"406":["16. So what is that, you're in 10th grade?"],"407":["So 11th grade. Have you of nanotechnology?","Have you heard of this term before?"],"408":["What do you think of","when you think of nanotechnology?"],"409":["You know, you're right.","When you read about some of these technologies,","it does feel like science fiction.","But the part of nanotechnology","I wanted to talk to you about","is stuff that you probably use every day,","most of your day, all of the time.","Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology","I'm gonna talk to you about?"],"410":["Yeah, so modern computer chips","rely heavily on nanotechnology.","Does this look familiar to you?","Can you guess what this might be?"],"411":["So this is a silicon wafer,","and they're embedded in basically almost every object","that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars,","television sets, appliances.","We ended up cutting these into little squares","and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor.","And those chips are what goes into all of these objects.","What I want to talk to you about is how we got","from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit","18 billion of these little devices","in a little one inch by one inch area.","They're called transistors. It's a switch.","Very simply, think of it as a light switch","that turns on and turns off using an electric field","by applying a voltage."],"412":["I went through my kid's Lego bins","to build a very simple model of a transistor.","And these are wired together in circuits","so that you can do computation.","You can do logic with them.","Where nanotechnology comes into play,","the way you double the number of transistors on a chip.","Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?"],"413":["You have to make it smaller. Exactly.","But here's the problem.","So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small","that if you shrunk them this gate,","that actually turns it on and off","loses its ability to control the channel.","And so what they did, was they took devices like this","into these things, we call them, FinFETs,","kind of like a fin on a fish.","So they're very thin transistors.","The width of these fins is only six nanometers. Okay?","So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across.","And they repeat this","over the entire wafer just about perfectly.","It's just a huge feat in engineering.","But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices","that your phones and computers either have,","or will have in the near future.","And it's a way that nanotechnology","is directly impacting you right now."],"414":["Exactly.","So these are made using a technique called lithography.","You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer.","Then you put a mask on it","and then you shine light through it.","And the features of the mask, the size of those holes","determine the feature size in the chip.","It's not just the size of the mask that matters.","It's the wavelength of the light that's used.","We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before,","but this is real stuff that's being produced,","that's being made, that's being used every day by people."],"415":["Exactly. I couldn't put it any better. That's right."],"416":["So what's your major?"],"417":["What made you choose that?"],"418":["So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?"],"419":["I think to really get deep into nanomaterials","and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand","to some level, quantum mechanics.","What it teaches us","as we make these devices smaller and smaller,","their properties begin to now depend","on the size and the orientation of these devices.","There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class,","you know about this, that are intrinsically thin.","As they're grown, as they're fabricated,","they're already at the nanoscale and they possess","these quantum confinement properties","that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit.","And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about","are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?"],"420":["So these are","typically semiconductors.","They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide","and they're small clusters of atoms.","They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers.","What's interesting about these materials?"],"421":["That's correct. Yeah.","Because of quantum confinement,","once you get below this 15 nanometer range,","the band gap of the material","depends completely on the size of the material.","So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap,","you have to change the material, right?","But in these quantum dots specifically,","just by changing the size, you can change their band gap.","And because their band gap is changing,","their optical properties are different.","And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light","that they emit just by changing their size."],"422":["There are people that are exploring","using these materials for diode lasers.","There are companies that are building displays","from these materials.","And there're even people thinking about","if I take these quantum dots,","and I change the chemistry on the outside","so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue,","that I could really do some interesting imaging","and therapeutic work to track disease,","even maybe to treat disease,","if you can very precisely control the chemistry."],"423":["The optical applications are in development.","The science has really been worked out.","The health stuff, because of all of the things","you have to consider when you're putting something","in someone's body is definitely further out there.","For example, some of them are made from cadmium.","Cadmium's toxic.","You would never put that in someone's body.","But there are other materials like gold and silver","and titanium dioxide, which are less toxic","and people are exploring using those.","So have you learned about graphene?"],"424":["Do you know what this is?"],"425":["Carbon nanotube, right.","So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it","and the angle, you roll it with,","it has different properties.","So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal.","If I roll it a different way,","it'll act like a semiconductor.","The one that gets everyone most excited","is that the electrons and holes","move very fast through graphene.","And so there's a lot of interest in using these","for certain types of high-speed electronics.","The other interesting application","is because it's one atom thin,","it's very sensitive to changes in the environment.","And so there's a lot of interest","in using them as diagnostics.","It's on us researchers to find ways","to A, control that process and then B, to actually build","some sort of interesting technology from them."],"426":["You're speaking my language.","This is what I spent many years of my life working on.","You don't physically roll up graphene.","You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals","and you deposit them on a surface.","And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition.","So you basically flow in a carbon source,","the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal","and then once nanocrystal is saturated,","the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes.","Then you have to develop ways","to go into this pile of nanotubes","and pull out exactly the ones that you want.","So I have to find ways to program them","to go exactly in the places that I want.","I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules","that recognize one type of surface over another.","And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land","exactly where we want them to.","And it's still very much in the research stage.","The ultimate goal is to build functional","high-speed electronics using these new materials."],"427":["Yeah. 100%. That's right.","And that's the motivation","for looking at these emerging materials.","But I would never bet against the innovation","and the creativity in this nano electronic space.","Tens of thousands of scientists,","every time they hit a barrier, at least historically,","as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it.","It's a real marvel in ingenuity."],"428":["It's just pretty lights. [laughing]","But now that you suggested it, these were inspired","by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier.","So that's the story I'm going to stick with.","[laughing] I like it."],"429":["So you're a graduate student.","And so tell me a bit about your work."],"430":["What is it about nanomaterials, that scale","and the properties of these materials","that make them uniquely promising","to incorporate into battery technology?"],"431":["What is it exactly that you're trying to tease","out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?"],"432":["Because the materials are so small,","they're at the nanoscale,","their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics,","which means that even slight changes in their size,","in their orientation","give profound changes in their properties.","And while that's very scientifically interesting,","and it allows you to tune their properties","by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view,","it's a bit of a headache in the sense","that in technology want to optimize for a property","and then repeat that over and over again.","So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab","related to working with these materials","and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?"],"433":["That's actually, I think a very common problem.","We can build a device in the lab","it could be a transistor, can be a battery.","And then you ask the question,","okay, so what's the next step?","How do we take it from that lab demonstration","into a technology?","The kind of work that I'm very interested in","is developing tools","to make the exact type of materials that you want.","The tools that we've used in the past","for conventional fabrication","just don't work with these materials","because they're all grown from the bottom up.","They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways","to either use chemistry or some other means","to get them to assemble into the structures that you want","to actually either grow specifically what you want","or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want.","You need to be able to build that same thing","over and over again, with the exact same properties.","No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab","is gonna solve all of these problems on their own","because they are difficult problems.","And there is a real important payoff at the end.","And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions","to push this field forward."],"434":["I remember reading your papers when I was a student","and we're all trying to create these materials","and finding ways to exploit their properties.","What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here","to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature","and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way","to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures","with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired","by that to do the research that you're doing now."],"435":["It's really fascinating work,","especially now we're all familiar","with the viruses and how they act.","And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures.","So how did you come to that?","And then how do you actually program a virus","to do your bidding?"],"436":["So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses","to build the materials that you want them to build","by exposing them to the raw materials","and then evolving their function.","We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials.","That critical issue that we're facing","is how do you go from those single experiments","with a single material, understanding its properties,","how do you scale that to the billions of devices","that you need in a technology?","It is a chemistry driven approach.","We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them,","but to take that one step,","and to tie into what you're doing,","tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration","where instead of using conventional chemistry,","that we can train some of these biological elements","to do that work work for us."],"437":["It's really fascinating.","You have all these little worker viruses","building the materials for you.","How are you then applying these materials","that you're building?"],"438":["Looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years,","where do you see your own work,","and maybe the field more broadly?"],"439":["One of the things I love about about nanoscience","is it tends to break up the silos","between those traditional scientific disciplines.","My training was in chemistry,","but I had to very quickly merged chemistry and physics.","And now I see an area where chemistry, physics,","and biology are coming together to produce new materials","and new technology, and to advance the field forward.","And so being in this field,","you kind of have to cross pollinate","between these different disciplines","and kind of advance the field together."],"440":["So Angela,","thank you so much for joining us.","And I look forward to seeing more work","coming out of your lab in the future."],"441":["I really enjoy talking to these five different people","about nanotechnology.","Nanotechnology is a field that affects all of us every day","as finds its way into a variety of applications.","And I hope you enjoyed it as well and see the impact","that nanotechnology has on your life today,","and how much more of an impact it'll have","on all of our lives in the future"],"442":["Yes."],"443":["Nice to meet you too!"],"444":["Yeah."],"445":["Nhn nhn."],"446":["A baby ant?"],"447":["Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny."],"448":["Yes.","I first heard of them","on a show I watched called StoryBots.","They're just little things","that make up everything on Earth, even earth."],"449":["Yeah!"],"450":["I would want to make a unicorn out of atoms."],"451":["Why do you study stuff so small?"],"452":["Cool."],"453":["I'm 16."],"454":["Junior year."],"455":["Yeah, I've heard of it."],"456":["It kind of seems very science fiction."],"457":["My phone?"],"458":["I don't know."],"459":["OK."],"460":["You make it smaller?"],"461":["How do you make stuff that small?","Obviously it's not handmade, so is it factories and stuff?"],"462":["In middle school, I built all of the little switches","where you turn the electricity on,","and it goes from one thing to the other.","But those are the really big, comical,","like plugging in Legos and stuff.","When we saw the picture of all of the little ones,","it's like a city, it's crazy how simple","and complex it is at the same time."],"463":["Chemical engineering."],"464":["Like any freshman,","going into chemical engineering,","I was like, I like chemistry!","So I'm gonna go into chemical engineering.","But luckily I also like","all the math and all the science too."],"465":["I have. I took that last year."],"466":["Yes."],"467":["Well, the other day we were talking about","the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology.","So all the way from like 0D to 3D.","If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?"],"468":["What are the applications of these quantum dots?"],"469":["How far away is this","from being actually used on an industrial level?"],"470":["Yeah."],"471":["Carbon nanotube?"],"472":["So you've been talking about","the different ways you can say, roll these nanotubes.","So how do you go about building","and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?"],"473":["In my nanomaterials class,","actually just a couple of days ago,","we were talking about different applications","of nanotechnology and things we know.","And we touched on the topic that right now,","silicon is down to the smallest level that it can get.","And so we have scientists out there","researching other materials, to replace silicon."],"474":["I gotta ask.","The lights that are behind you, is that related","to the quantum dots that you work with at all?"],"475":["Well, thank you so much. This was all so very interesting."],"476":["I've been working on energy storage materials.","And the most popular are batteries that we work on.","A lot of the revolution that's come in electronics","is kind of our model","to try and use some nanoscale advances","and put them into batteries."],"477":["So for batteries, one of the main constraints","when we're designing batteries is trying to maintain","or reduce the volume and mass of the components.","And nanomaterials are particularly well suited","to adding functionality","while having this negligible increase in volume.","So we get a huge benefit from using nano materials","without sacrificing the volume of the battery."],"478":["At first, one of the main things that we did","was use nanomaterials to add conductivity.","And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good","at adding conductivity to batteries.","And then in the subsequent years,","nanomaterials have been really interesting","from things like incorporating sensors into batteries,","to increasing the functionality of batteries,","having some responsive materials","that use things like graphene sheets","that are incorporated into a matrix,","and then you add a safety functionality to a battery.","We're trying to squeeze out","almost all the functionality that we can.","And as new nano materials are being discovered","and there're new properties being discovered,","a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way","to translate that into a battery."],"479":["I think every step of a process in a battery","is something where you have to think about","how would this translate to making a battery","in terms of the production?","One thing that I think is very interesting","about the field of nanoscale materials in general,","is that how you make the material","changes the properties a lot.","And so we claim that this 2D material has this property,","then tying that to the battery performance","is something that's pretty difficult to do.","It takes a few steps in between.","So we have to think kind of creatively","with how we can do that."],"480":["Life gave us this toolkit","that is already on the nanoscale.","So we think that that's a great place","to think about making materials on the nano scale","and manipulating materials on the nano scale,","and wiring them together as well.","This abalone shell, you can see","the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it.","This is a nano composite material.","If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it","in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see","is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets.","And I studied that as a graduate student.","I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing.","You have an organism in the ocean,","that takes what's in its environment,","which is calcium and carbonate.","That's dissolved in the water and templates it","into this really exquisite structure.","And so you think that's great.","Calcium carbonate is great,","but what if we wanted to make a solar cell","or a another electronic device or a battery,","how would you get an organism to do that?","And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea.","But is it really that crazy if this abalone,","already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago?","So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells.","Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts?","Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?"],"481":["We work on something","called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA.","This particular bacteriophage called M13 bacteriophage","is made up of single stranded DNA and proteins.","It's long and thin.","So it's 880 nanometers in length,","and it's about 9 nanometers in diameter.","And so one of the reasons I love it","is it spans the nanoscale","and almost the micron scale at the same time.","Take the single strand DNAs, obviously a model,","and you can cut it with molecular scissors.","And you can put a new piece of DNA in between.","And so you put a small piece of DNA in there","that doesn't belong there.","And that piece of DNA","is going to randomly code for a protein.","Now, the next time that that virus is replicated","within a bacterial host,","it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat,","just a short protein sequence on the coat,","maybe like 8 or 12 amino acids in length.","And just like that abalone is going to grab calcium","and build calcium carbonate.","We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate","for a battery electrode material","or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide","for a semiconductor material."],"482":["Biology is chemistry.","Molecules, proteins,","and DNA work with all the same kinds of bonding","and things that the chemicals","that you're gonna be looking for in these processes.","It's put together in a way","that when a protein or enzyme folds,","it almost always folds correctly.","That's kind of the beauty of it,","the predictable aspect of it encoded in its DNA.","If we need to make it the same over and over again,","then as long as you have the right DNA sequence,","DNA is a beautiful structure on the nanoscale.","And there's really, really cool, incredible work","on DNA origami, when DNA can fold","into just the right structure.","And so I can see that as an interface,","that would be really cool and interesting in your work.","And you can have the virus make the DNA for the DNA origami,","and then you use DNA to assemble your beautiful structures."],"483":["We started thinking about","how can we make an impact in cancer?","We do it mostly in imaging technology","to look deep inside the body noninvasively with light.","And the way that we came about that","was through solar cells and batteries.","We trained our viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes","and hold onto them very, very tightly.","And then we'll give a virus a second gene,","decode for a protein, to grow, in a case of a battery,","a battery electrode material.","It allows it to weave together a good electrical conductor","and a good ionic conductor at the same time,","all within this really, really small space.","And the optical properties of these carbon nanotubes","are in the wavelength.","That is interesting for imaging deep inside the body.","We started building a bunch of imaging tools","that could image above a thousand nanometers, a wave length.","And so this is in [audio distorting]","and that's a really special window","where you have some optical transparency","of tissue in the body.","The other gene, we engineered to find ovarian cancer.","We developed imaging tools with Harvard Medical School","and MIT Lincoln Labs to find tiny ovarian tumors.","It's hard to see things less than a centimeter in size","with ovarian cancer, just based on the location in the body.","But with our imaging system, we could find tumors","that were below a millimeter in size, actually."],"484":["The future I'd like to see","is environmentally friendly chemistry","and materials synthesis.","And I think that we're really going that way.","If we think about batteries of the future,","solar cells of the future,","thinking about earth abundant materials and processes","that are compatible with the earth and environment."],"485":["I agree completely. We like to solve problems.","Nano bio is the toolkit that we bring a lot.","It happens to be a very strong and evolving toolkit.","That's another thing that I love about biology","is if you can come up with a solution","that's not perfect at all to begin with","when you're making a battery electrode material","or any kind of material you're making,","you have evolution on your side","to try to make it better and better as a function of time.","That can be quite rapid."],"486":["Thanks for having me, George,","it was really fun to interact, and I'm very excited","about our future collaborations.","Me too. Absolutely."],"487":["Hi, I'm Janna Levin, I'm an astrophysicist,","and I've been asked to explain gravity","in five levels of increasing complexity.","Gravity seems so familiar and so everyday,","and yet it's this incredibly esoteric abstract subject","that has shaped the way we view the universe","on the larger scales,","has given us the strangest phenomena in the universe","like black holes","that has changed the way we look at the entirety of physics.","It's really been a revolution because of gravity."],"488":["Are you interested in science?"],"489":["Yes, you are?"],"490":["Do you know what gravity is?"],"491":["That's pretty good.","So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth,","and the Earth to us.","But the Earth is so much bigger","that even though we're actually pulling the Earth","a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much.","You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit."],"492":["[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body","compared to anything else very nearby","that it has the larger effect,","pulling the water of the Earth.","But more than the Moon, think about the Sun","pulling on the Earth.","We orbit the whole Sun,","just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon","and causes the Moon to orbit us.","All of those things are acting on you and me right now."],"493":["That's such a good question.","No, we actually couldn't.","In the Moon, gravity is weaker,","you can almost float between footsteps","if you look at the astronauts on the Moon.","On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger.","If you go to a bigger, heavier planet,","it gets harder and harder.","But there are stars that have died","that are so dense that there's no way","we could lift our arms,","no way we could step or walk.","The gravity is just way too strong.","Do you know how tall you are?"],"494":["Maybe four three.","People think that while you're sleeping,","your body has a chance to stretch out","and gravity isn't crunching you together,","but when you're standing or walking or sitting,","the gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly,","so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller","than in the evening.","See if it works for you.","[Woman] Wow."],"495":["Yes."],"496":["They say that astronauts in space,","definitely their spine elongates.","There were two twin astronauts,","one who stayed here on Earth","and the other who went to the International Space Station.","He was there for a long time, and when he came back,","he was actually taller than his twin brother."],"497":["Yeah, and that was because gravity","wasn't compressing him all the time","and he was floating freely","in the International Space Station","and his spine just kind of elongated.","After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust,","he'll go back to the same size.","Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?"],"498":["Isaac Newton would ponder,","how does the Earth cause things to fall?","There's a famous story that Isaac Newton","was sitting under a tree","and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head","and he had an epiphany and understood this law,","this mathematical law for how that works.","I don't actually think that's a true story, though."],"499":["But it's a good story.","So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier,","you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter,","that that's the same.","Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier,","you'll hit the ground with much greater force,","but you will hit the ground at the same time."],"500":["Yep, so like a penny from the Empire State Building","will fall at the same rate as a bowling ball."],"501":["Yeah, amazing.","Wanna try it?"],"502":["A light object, see how light that is."],"503":["Very light?"],"504":["And a heavy object."],"505":["They look the same, but this is much heavier, right?","Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front,","a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop,","and then drop them.","[balls thud] [Janna laughs]","Did they fall at the same time?","Did they hit at the same time?","So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized","that that's the same force that keeps the Moon","in orbit around the Earth","and the Earth in orbit around the Sun,","and that's a huge leap.","Here he is, looking at just things around him,","and then looks at the stars","and has this really big realization,","that that's actually the same force.","So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?"],"506":["Newton."],"507":["That's beautiful, I'm impressed."],"508":["So, Maria, you're in high school?"],"509":["[Janna] And are you studying any sciences in high school?"],"510":["Do you think of yourself as curious about science?"],"511":["What interests you?"],"512":["What's your impression of what gravity is?"],"513":["So you're saying gravity pulls things down,","yet we've launched things into space.","Do you ever wonder how we do that?"],"514":["Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology","once things are out in the solar system.","So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets","so that when some of the spacecraft gets close,","it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up.","But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down,","so when we want to send a rocket into space,","when we wanna go to the Moon,","when we wanna send supplies","to the International Space Station,","the trick is to get something moving fast enough","that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth.","Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down?","It's actually not true.","If you throw it fast enough,","you can actually get something","that doesn't come back down again,","and that's basically how rocket launches work.","You have to get the rocket for the Earth","to go more than 11 kilometers a second.","Think of how fast it is.","Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers.","If you get it to go that fast,","it's not gonna come back down again.","So you know the International Space Station","which is orbiting the Earth?","That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour.","It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off.","So it's just there falling forever.","So once it's out there, it's not coming back down","as long as it's cruising like that."],"515":["In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it.","So have you ever had a yo-yo","where you swing it around like this?","The string is pulling it in at all times,","but you've also given it this angular momentum.","And as long as you give it the angular momentum,","pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit.","And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times,","so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line.","It keeps coming back around.","So it's funny, people think","that the International Space Station","is so far away that they're not feeling gravity,","and that's not the case at all.","They're absolutely feeling gravity.","They're just cruising so fast that,","even though they're being pulled in,","they never get pulled to the surface."],"516":["Yeah, you feel pinned to that.","It's exactly like that.","There's something called the equivalence principle","where people realized, especially Einstein,","that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship","and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating","at exactly the right rate,","you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting","on the floor of a building around the Earth","or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating."],"517":["Yeah.","You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train","and the other one moves and for a second","you're not sure if you're the one moving?"],"518":["That's because in some sense, you're really not.","Imagine you're in this train","and it's going near the speed of light","relative to the platform,","but it's so smooth,","then you should be in a situation","in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion,","there's no absolute motion.","So that if you throw a ball up,","you might think from the outside of the platform,","be confused that when gravity pulls that back down,","it's gonna hit you or something,","but it'll land in your palm","as surely as if you were in your living room."],"519":["So imagine you were an astronaut","and you were floating in empty space.","You can't see anything.","There's no stars, there's no Earth.","You can ask yourself, am I moving?","There's really no way for you to tell.","So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving.","So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you,","and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second,","and you say, Marina, you're cruising","at thousands of kilometers a second,","you're going so fast.","But she had just done the same experiment.","She was just floating in space thinking,","Am I moving?","There's no way to know which one of you is moving","and there's no meaning to the absolute motion.","The only thing that's true","is that you're in relative motion, that's true.","You both agree you're in relative motion,","and that's clear.","But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving","and I'm stationary."],"520":["So let me tell you where it gets really crazy."],"521":["So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space","and you can't tell who's moving.","Let's say you both see a flash of light.","A flash of light comes from somewhere,","you don't know where.","So you measure the speed of light","to be 300,000 kilometers per second.","But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse,","as far as you can tell.","Two cars driving towards each other","seem like they're going faster towards each other","than somebody who's standing still","relative to one of the cars,","right?"],"522":["So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure","a different speed of light.","But she comes back and she says, No.","300,000 kilometers per second.","Because from her perspective, she's standing still,","and the laws of physics have better be the same for her.","The speed of light is a fact of nature","that's as true as the strength of gravity.","And the two of you are in this quandary","because if one of you is the preferred person","who correctly measures the speed of light,","that ruins everything about the idea","of the relativity of motion.","Which one of you should it be?","So Einstein decides they must both measure","the same speed of life.","How could that possibly, possibly be the case?","And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel,","your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time,","then there must be something wrong with space and time.","And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light","and a respect for this idea of relativity","to the idea that space and time must not be the same","for you and for Marina.","And that's how he gets the idea","of the relativity of space and time.","[laughs] You have the best expression on your face. [laughs]","It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually,","of the whole theory of relativity.","That starting point leads to","this complete revolution in physics","where we suddenly have a Big Bang","and black holes and space-time.","Just from that one simple starting point.","So, is your impression of gravity different","than when we started the conversation?"],"523":["And it's a really deep principle.","And what about the theory of gravity?"],"524":["It's like a big paradigm."],"525":["So, you're in college?"],"526":["[Janna] And what are you studying in college?"],"527":["So, from your perspective,","how would you describe gravity?"],"528":["So, when you say it's an inverse-square law,","that means that the closer you are,","the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull.","And that makes sense.","There's very few things that are stronger","when you're further apart."],"529":["So you can also think of a gravitational field,","something that permeates all of space.","Even though the earth is three stories below us,","it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance.","We're actually interacting with the field at this point","and there's a real interaction right here at this point.","And that's nice, because people were worried","that if things acted at a distance,","that the way that old-fashioned","inverse-square force law describes it,","that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon,","that it was like telekinesis.","If you don't touch something, how do you affect it?","And so the first step was to start to think of gravity","as a field that permeates all of a space.","And it's weaker very far from the Earth","and it's closer very close to the Earth.","So one way to think of this field","as a field that's really describing","a curved space-time that is everywhere.","Forget the difficulty of the math,","just the intuition comes from","two kind of simple observations.","One was what Einstein described","as the happiest thought of his life.","So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair,","and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet,","or standing in an elevator cab.","And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it,","or the floor, or the elevator?","Those aren't gravitational objects.","So he wanted to eliminate them,","and one way to do the thought experiment","is to imagine standing in an elevator","that you can see out of, a black box.","And imagine the cable is cut","and you and the elevator begin to fall."],"530":["You're in total free fall.","Now, because things fall at the same rate,","including the elevator and you,","you can actually float in the elevator.","If you just floated in the elevator,","the two of you would drop,","and you might not even know you're falling.","You could take an apple and drop it in front of you,","and it would float in front of you.","You would actually experience weightlessness.","It's called the equivalence principle.","It was Einstein's happiest thought","that what you're really doing","when you're experiencing gravity","isn't being heavy in your chair,","it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field.","And that was the first step,","to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling."],"531":["Yeah, exactly."],"532":["You can make somebody look like","they're in the International Space Station","by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling,","the plane just drops out of the air.","And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly,","and there's been a lot of experiments about it,","but you don't want it to end unhappily,","so the plane has to scoop back up,","and then you see them","become pinned to the floor of the plane,","because then the plane is interrupting their fall.","So that's the first thought,","and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased?","So if you were floating in empty space,","really empty space, and you had an apple,","and you threw the apple,","what shape do you think it would chase, the path?"],"533":["Yeah, it would just go straight.","But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?"],"534":["Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc.","And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc.","So the second step to think about curved space-time","is to say that when things fall freely","around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths,","as though space-time itself, space itself was curved."],"535":["You had that moment,","I saw that it your face!"],"536":["You went, Oh.","[Janna and Lisa laugh]","So, that's the intuition,","that's how Einstein gets from thinking","that space-time is curved from the idea that, well,","there's this field that permeates all of space,","and what is really describing is the curves","that things fall along.","And from there, it's a very long path","to finding the mathematics and the right description,","that's really hard.","But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful","and just comes from these two simple thought experiments."],"537":["Isn't it kind of amazing?"],"538":["So you described learning in a class about light","the theory of special relativity","where Einstein is really adhering","to the constancy of the speed of light","and questioning the absolute nature of space and time.","And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity,","but he later begins to think about","the incompatibility of gravity","with his theory of relativity.","So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow.","Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way","to evaporate the Sun.","In Newton's understanding of gravity,","we would instantaneously know about it","all the way over here at the Earth.","And that's incompatible with the concept","that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.","No information, not even information about the Sun,","could possibly travel faster than the speed of light.","So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun","for a full eight minutes,","which is the time it would take light to travel to us.","And so he begins to question","why gravity is so incompatible with relativity,","but he already knows he's thinking about","space and time in relativity.","So then he gets to his general theory of relativity","where he realizes if I eliminate everything","but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth","and I look at how things fall","and I see that they follow curves,","well, then he realizes that space and time","don't just contract or dilate,","that they can really warp,","that they can bend and that they can curve.","And then he finds a way","to make gravity compatible with relativity","by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow,","the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time","would actually begin to ripple,","and those are the gravitational waves,","and they would change and they would flatten out,","'cause the Sun was no longer there.","And that would take the light-travel time to get to us","to tell us that the Sun was gone,","and then we would stop orbiting","and just travel along a straight line."],"539":["Wow.","[Janna and Lisa laughs]","Well, let's hope it doesn't happen."],"540":["So what do you think you walk away with?","What do you think you learned?"],"541":["Yeah, it does for me too, so thank you. [laughs]"],"542":["So you're getting your PhD in physics?"],"543":["So what would that have to do","with gravity or astrophysics?"],"544":["So what I love about neutron stars personally","is that they're kind of city-sized,","right?"],"545":["[Janna] They're about the size of a city.","So you're imagining something","more than the mass of the Sun."],"546":["Now, that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong","around the neutron star.","So what would happen if we were on a neutron star,","because of the gravity?"],"547":["So what's the connection","between neutron stars and black holes?"],"548":["Black holes are so amazing","that when the neutron star stops","and there's something actually there.","There's material there.","If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole,","so it keeps falling,","once the event horizon of the black hole forms,","which is the shadow,","the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape,","the material keeps falling.","And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down","right at the center there, but whatever happens,","the star's gone, that black hole is empty.","So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing."],"549":["There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet,","and that probably means that's where Einstein's","theory of gravity as a curved space-time","is beginning to break down,","and we need to take the extra step","of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity.","And we don't have that yet.","So even though the black hole isn't completely understood,","we do know that they form astronomically,","that in the universe things like neutron stars form","and things like black holes form.","The consequences are very much speaking","to this curved space-time.","So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other,","they're like mallets on a drum,","and they actually cause space-time to ring,","and it's very much part of gravitation.","The ringing of space-time itself,","we call gravitational waves.","And this was something Einstein thought about","right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that."],"550":["[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum,","and you can record the sound of that ringing","after a billion years,","when it's traveled through the universe.","But then the next thing that happens is","those neutron stars collide,","and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter,","which you study,","it becomes this firework of different explosions.","It's really quite spectacular."],"551":["Yeah, it was, to my knowledge,","the most widely studied astronomical event","in the history of humanity."],"552":["So when the gravitational waves were recorded","and they realized, oh this sounds like,","you can reconstruct the shape and size","of the mallets of the drum from the sound,","these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes.","And so, like you said, there was a trigger","for satellites and experiments all over the world","to point roughly in the direction","that the sound was coming from.","So, from your point of view,","they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding,","an experiment you could never do on Earth.","That's just the most tremendous scales","and peculiarities of matter."],"553":["[Janna] The way you do in a bomb.","It's basically nuclear fusion."],"554":["Yeah, it's amazing.","It's literally populating the periodic table."],"555":["So you are already a PhD student,","you know a lot about gravity,","but what do you think you've taken away","from this conversation?"],"556":["See, you're a scientist. [laughs]","Isn't the best part being able to ask the questions?"],"557":["So we've been talking about gravity","from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon,","pulling on each other in the conventional sense","of gravity being an attractive force,","to the Earth creating curves in space-time,","then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy","and space-time as the real universe","and gravitation is really just talking about","space-time in general, and here we are,","and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics.","Where would you take the exposition of gravity","from that point?"],"558":["So when we think about quantum mechanics,","we think about particles and their quantum charges","in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us.","They come in and they exchange a force carrier","and then they come out again,","so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering,","for instance, or something like that.","And the language that Einstein gave us is so different.","It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time.","And it's also unnecessary."],"559":["Is there really space-time","or are we just using unnecessary language","because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful?"],"560":["To have the waves together."],"561":["So do you think there's some sense","in which we shouldn't be thinking","about individual universes, individual space-time,","so we should be thinking about","superpositions of space-times?"],"562":["So when we're talking about","the multiverse or the Big Bang,","we are really talking about gravity ultimately,","and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation","which we know think of as a theory of space-time","has a quantum explanation,","has a quantum paradigm imposed on it","that will help us understand these things,","and we don't have that yet.","One of the things that I think is so amazing","is that the terrains in which we're going to understand","quantum gravity are very few.","It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know","that quantum and gravity both were called into action.","And there's black holes.","One of the most interesting discoveries","is of course Hawking's discovery,","kick-started a kind of crisis, right?","In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity","were so knocking heads.","It was one of the most beautiful examples."],"563":["This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality.","You can't precisely say where the electron is,","and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving."],"564":["Right."],"565":["This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe","actually is forced to radiate quantum particles","is pretty wild.","I think everyone understood","that it was a correct calculation,","but I don't think a lot of people","understood the implications,","that it meant something really terrible was happening.","Because this black hole,","which could have been made of who knows what,","is disappearing into these quantum particles","which, in some sense, have nothing to do","with the material that went in.","So do you think that's a big crisis?","The black hole evaporates, the information is lost?"],"566":["Practical purposes."],"567":["So this is a huge crisis","'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong,","and as you described it,","it's the most accurately-tested paradigm","in the history of physics,","how could it be wrong, right?","Or the event horizon is letting information out","and violating one of the most","sacred principles of relativity."],"568":["That's a nice way of looking at it.","So that you're not actually violating classical relativity","once you're in a regime where the wave function","has really peaked around a very well-defined stage."],"569":["Yes, so one of the things I like to think of","with holography is that I can pack","a certain amount of information in a black hole.","I mean, you can literally think of it","as throwing things into it.","So let's say I have information in some volume","and I'm under the illusion","that I can just keep packing information in that volume,","as much as the volume will contain.","Eventually I'll make a black hole","and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information","I can pack into anything in the entire universe","is what I can pack on the area.","And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume,","maybe the whole world is just a hologram.","It's not a principle that only applies to black holes.","It's saying that,","if this theory of quantum gravity is correct,","then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion","and really the universe is two-dimensional.","That's crazy."],"570":["[Janna laughs]"],"571":["A smaller and smaller space,","trying to pack it denser and denser,","until eventually we make a black hole."],"572":["Right, exactly.","And the most knowledge you could ever have","would only be on a two-dimensional surface."],"573":["Do you think it's possible","that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics","and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways","that we've been talking about so far,","like the Newtonian way and the space-time way,","that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions?","Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature.","Temperature is not a thing.","There is no single thing called temperature.","It's a macroscopic illusion","that comes from the collective behavior,","really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms.","And is it possible that the whole of gravity","is some kind of emergent illusion","from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?"],"574":["I mean, temperature is still great to talk about.","It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature.","I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats","and talk about temperature.","But if we look at it closer and closer and closer,","we realize there's not a thing in the world","that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated.","And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity","isolated from quantum mechanics."],"575":["So that's just like saying","there's the idea of a dual description.","It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary","between these two descriptions,","and so to belabor which one's real is silly.","It's like saying, is French or is English real?"],"576":["[Janna laughs]"],"577":["Yeah, you don't go to the doctor and say,","Heisenberg's uncertainty principle caused","a series of fluctuations."],"578":["Thanks so much for coming.","It's really good to have you here."],"579":["I hoped you learned something about gravity","you hadn't thought of before,","and I hope even more that it provoked some questions.","So thank you for watching."],"580":["Yes."],"581":["Yes."],"582":["It's something that, so, right now,","we would be floating if there was no gravity,","but since there's gravity","we're sitting right down on these chairs."],"583":["Mm-hmm, just like the ocean tides."],"584":["If gravity was too strong, would we be able to get up?"],"585":["I'm in the fours. In the fours?"],"586":["So that was last night?"],"587":["[Bonet screams]","Ooh."],"588":["Wow."],"589":["Mm-hmm."],"590":["Yeah."],"591":["So, if we both dropped down from a plane,","we would both land at the same time,","but you would land heavier?"],"592":["Oh my God."],"593":["Yeah."],"594":["That's..."],"595":["Yeah."],"596":["Oh my God. [Janna laughs]"],"597":["I've learned that the person that learned about the apple."],"598":["He was learning about gravity","just about what he saw on this planet.","I also learned that if you drop one light thing","and one heavy thing at the same height at the same time,","they're both gonna drop at the same time","but one's gonna drop a little heavier than the other."],"599":["Yeah, I'm a junior."],"600":["I'm taking physics right now."],"601":["Well, there are some things that interest me","and others that bore me, so it depends."],"602":["Well, I'm a gymnast, so in physics they talk about","force and stuff and then I think of how I use physics","in my own life."],"603":["I think that if there's no gravity,","everyone would float everywhere.","It pulls things down,","and without it, everything would be chaos."],"604":["Isn't it like a slingshot,","like if you pull something back enough","it'll go in the opposite direction?"],"605":["And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?"],"606":["It's like that ride at the rollercoasters","where you go in and it's spins super fast","and you can't feel it spinning fast but--"],"607":["That's crazy."],"608":["Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day","to go to school,","but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train,","and then I'm like, wait, what?"],"609":["Isn't that kinda crazy? Amazing."],"610":["[laughs] I don't even know what to say to that."],"611":["[Maria laughs]"],"612":["Yeah."],"613":["Yeah, 'cause I knew that when I was on the train","it didn't feel like I was moving,","but I didn't know why or that it was a thing","and I wasn't crazy.","[Janna and Maria laugh]"],"614":["I don't know, usually when I just heard gravity","it's from my coaches,","but I didn't know it was all these things."],"615":["Yeah."],"616":["I'm a physics major."],"617":["I'm taught that it's a force.","It's described by inverse law.","But I also know that it's a field.","And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves,","although I don't know the specific details about that."],"618":["Yeah."],"619":["So, in free fall?"],"620":["I know zero-gravity experiences","that are done with planes, I believe?"],"621":["Yeah, yeah."],"622":["Well, if I threw it straight,","I would think it would go straight."],"623":["It would just go down."],"624":["Oh."],"625":["Yeah, yeah, yeah."],"626":["That's amazing."],"627":["Yeah. [laughs]"],"628":["Wow."],"629":["Yeah. [Janna laughs]"],"630":["Well, I learned more about the intuitions","behind the concept.","'Cause we already just do the problems","but sometimes you get lost in the math,","but speaking like this it really helps build my intuition."],"631":["That's right.","Theoretical high energy physics.","Basically the physics of","really, really small fundamental things."],"632":["Well, what I'm looking at is states of matter","that might exist inside neutron stars.","So, when a star dies, if the star is massive enough,","there's a huge explosion, called a supernova,","and the stuff that's left behind","that doesn't get blown away","collapses into a tiny compact blob","called a neutron star."],"633":["That's right."],"634":["[Will] Yeah, or about the mass of the Sun,","condensed to the size of a city.","It's dense enough that one teaspoon-full","would weigh about a billion tons here on Earth."],"635":["We would immediately be crushed into the ground,","I think our bodies would be shred","into their subatomic particles."],"636":["So, as I understand it,","a black hole is sort of like a neutron star's big brother.","It's more intense, though.","If you have so much matter when a star is collapsing","that it can't hold itself up, it collapses to a black hole,","and those are so dense that space-time breaks down","in some way or another."],"637":["So is there a sensible way to talk","about what's inside a black hole,","or is that, should you think of it","as there is no space-time inside?"],"638":["Those waves are very exciting for me too","because neutron stars orbiting each other","also give off gravitational waves","and we might be able to get some data","about neutron star material from that kind of signal."],"639":["That's right, in fact,","when we recorded that for the first time","with gravitational waves,","we then pointed telescopes at it","and were able to see it optically as well,","and that gave scientists a lot of data."],"640":["Wow, that's amazing."],"641":["Absolutely.","I've heard statistics like many Earth masses worth of gold","were created, forged in the neutron star collision","that caused that.","We used to think that most elements in the universe","were created in supernova, which is when stars explode,","because there's so much violent activity at the center","that you need that kind of energy to create new elements."],"642":["Sure, but we now think that that kind of fusion happens","when two neutron stars collide.","If you think about it,","you have two massive blobs of neutrons.","When you smush them together, you've got neutrons colliding.","It creates the conditions where new elements can be created."],"643":["Yes, we now think that most of the heavy elements","after some number are created in neutron star collisions."],"644":["Well, I've definitely taken away","that the way that we think about gravity today","is very different from how Newton thought about it,","and that even though we have a very good understanding,","there's lots of things that we don't fully understand.","There's still a lot of questions to be answered,","which I think is really exciting."],"645":["Oh yeah."],"646":["Well, one thing is quantum mechanics.","Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory","in the history of science,","it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely.","Yet many people would still say we don't understand","even the basics of it."],"647":["Yeah, for me, the beauty of the theory of gravity is","the way Einstein formulated it,","as a theory of geometry, of curved space and time.","I think, like you, that's one of the things","that really pulled me into it."],"648":["Well, I think there's really space-time","in the sense that it's a description that works really well,","so there has to be something right about it.","I mean, if we're gonna talk about","what's really, really underlying that","and we're gonna put quantum mechanics into the mix,","then there should be some","quantum mechanical wave function for space-time.","You should be able to take two different space-times","and add them together,","'cause one of the crazy things about quantum mechanics,","as you know, it's--"],"649":["Yeah, and in two states","and in two possible states of the world,","you can just literally put a plus sign between them","and that's a sensible state, that's a good state,","it makes sense."],"650":["Yeah, I think so.","I think if you were to go far enough back","in the history of the universe,","back to when it was very, very dense, very small,","and when quantum mechanics was certainly important,","then it must have been like that.","I mean, if we believe that","the dominant standard model of cosmology,","something had to produce the density perturbations,","the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars","and everything else in the world.","So there's a galaxy over there, let's say,","and not over there, so how did that happen?","Why is there a galaxy there and not there?","In the standard theory, as you know,","that was a quantum event, a random event.","And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there","'cause you flipped a coin,","it actually happened in both places.","There's gotta be a wave function","where in one branch of the wave function","there's a galaxy there and not there,","and on the other branch it's the opposite."],"651":["Sure, yeah, it is a beautiful, beautiful idea.","So, first of all, to be totally clear, though,","we've never observed Hawking radiation,","which is what he predicted, directly.","I don't think very many people doubt that it's there,","but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically","that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon,","it's got a surface which is a point of no return.","If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have,","no matter how powerful the rocket you've got,","even if you beam a flashlight back behind you","in the direction you fall from,","nothing escapes, not even light.","It all gets sucked in and spaghettified","and destroyed at the singularity,","or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out.","But in quantum mechanics,","you can't really pin down","the location of something precisely.","If you try to pin down an electron","in a tiny circuit in a microchip,","sometimes you discover it's not actually there","and then your computer crashes."],"652":["Exactly, yeah, so when you get the blue screen of death,","that might be because of quantum mechanics."],"653":["You know, you try to pin something down","near a black hole, well, it's a surface,","it's got a particular radius for a round black hole,","and wanna say something is inside or outside,","well, you can't absolutely say that in quantum mechanics.","And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation,","which you can think of as pulling some of the energy","out of the black hole.","The black hole is formed out of some mass","and there's an energy in that.","If you think of pulling some energy out of that","and sending it off to infinity","in the form of particles being admitted.","And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum,","it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole,","but like an oven, the kind of radiation","that comes out of a cast iron."],"654":["It's a crisis because of some of the details of it,","but I would say the way you just described,","I mean, if I build a big bonfire or an incinerator","and I throw an encyclopedia into it,","good luck reconstructing what was in that encyclopedia.","The information is lost for all practical purpose."],"655":["Yes."],"656":["One thing about quantum mechanics is that","any time you have a state of the world","and another state of the world,","you can literally add them together","and get a third possible state,","as crazy as that sounds.","And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity,","then we can't really talk about there being a black hole","or not a black hole,","or an event horizon or not an event horizon,","because we could always a state","that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't,","or has the event horizon","in a slightly different position, maybe,","and add them together.","So the existence or position of an event horizon","can't possibly be determined as a fact","any more than the position of an electron is determined.","So I think that's the loophole."],"657":["That's right, and one of the most exciting developments","in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography,","and it's called holography because","a hologram is a two-dimensional surface","that creates a three-dimensional image.","It's got sort of 3D information built into it.","And this, in a fundamental way,","really has that 3D or higher dimensional information","built into it.","It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity","and more dimensions."],"658":["That's true."],"659":["And as practically speaking,","you mentioned before in our conversation","that it's really interesting","that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle","is a practical limit now in microchips.","If we make microchips much smaller than they already are,","even as they already are, it causes errors,","'cause you don't know that the electron's in.","If holography, if this limit on how much information","you can ever pack, if that ever become a limit,","as far as we know that's an absolute limit.","We started off with clay tablets,","not so much information per cubit centimeter or whatever.","Then we had written stuff that's getting better,","encyclopedias with thin paper that's even better, CDs."],"660":["Yeah, at some point you try to fill up","your encyclopedia with knowledge","and you get swallowed up by a black hole."],"661":["Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done.","So, you know, not likely","that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon."],"662":["If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely,","that's for sure, that's what it's telling us.","Although which side is the illusion","and which side is the reality?","They're the same."],"663":["Right, so I guess with the holographic description","we've got two sides, which are actually secretly the same.","On one side there's definitely no gravity.","On the other side, well,","it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means.","But the point is you can get it out,","it's equivalent to this theory."],"664":["Yeah, an example I like to give is","if you take some extra dimensions","and you compactify them, let's say just one,","all that is, it's exactly prevalent","to whatever particles you had,","whatever fields you had in your original theory","before you added it,","you just added an infinite tower of new particles","with certain properties that are all easy to calculate.","For me, it's a question of which description","is most useful.","I mean, if you wanna say gravity is an illusion","and it's all quantum, that's great,","but then you fall down the stairs and bang your head."],"665":["It's sort of like there's a description","that works pretty well."],"666":["Right, would you help me?","So there's so many open questions.","The fact that they are all these fundamental issues","that we really don't understand.","But, on the other hand, there's all these moving parts","that fit together so neatly.","There's definitely something that's working here.","But ultimately what is gonna emerge from that,","what structure is lying under it, we just don't know.","But I think the fact that there are","so many fundamental questions","that we just don't know the answer to,","that is an opportunity, that's exciting, it's great."],"667":["Thank you very much, Janna, it was my pleasure."],"668":["H\u00ee, I'm John Carmack.","I'm the chief technology officer for Oculus.","I work on virtual reality.","I've been challenged today to talk about one concept","at five levels of increasing complexity.","So we're going to be talking about reality and virtual","reality, what the technology allows us to do today,","what it may allow us to do in future, and whether","that should even be our goal to approximate reality."],"669":["So do you know what virtual reality is?"],"670":["That's actually a really good description.","The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make","you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you","believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of","a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean."],"671":["Yeah, or in Minecraft.","When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like","a picture of a mountain or something,","how can you tell that its not just a window","and there's something else behind it.","Because it always doesn't look quite right","if you have a static picture of a person on a screen","and you move around like this, its not really changing.","And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out","We need to figure out when you look at something in reality","how can you tell whether its real or not.","Have you been to a 3-D movie","where you put on the little glasses?"],"672":["So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever","at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look","at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually","two pictures that they're showing at the same time.","And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye","see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture.","So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing","through the screen or something is floating out","in front of it.","In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either","two screens or one screen split in half,","so that it draws a different picture,","completely different picture, for each eye.","And we make sure that each eye can only","see the picture it intended to.","And that's what can make things feel like they got this real","depth to them, that its something that you could reach out","and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen."],"673":["Try look over there and concentrate on his face over there.","Can you see me waving my hand without turning your eyes?"],"674":["Alright, so, at some point,","you can probably see it right now?","So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard,","tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?"],"675":["You can just barely tell.","And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand","and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry","because there's that difference there.","And you can change between that, like you can then focus","on your foot and your hand gets blurry.","Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail","in different places.","So we're hoping in the future,","that hardware can be like that.","Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail","right where you're looking.","And every time you look someplace else,","it moves the detail over to there.","So we don't need to render a hundred times","as much as we've got right now.","Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem.","What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera","and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out","is the eye looking over here or up here.","We're working hard on stuff like this right now","so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's","as detailed and realistic feeling","as the reality that we've actually got around us.","But its going to be a long time before we get to","where we can really fool people."],"676":["So do you have a basic sense of what latency is?"],"677":["Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts","of the system: monitors can be a big one.","Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds","or more of latency just in the TV part.","And then you've got the processing and the computer","and all of these add up to the total latency."],"678":["Games that feel really good, they've got that sense","of it happens instantly when you're doing something."],"679":["30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were,","you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea","well you could spend a million dollars and buy","a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster.","And that's not really true today.","For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after","another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC","is about the fastest thing in the world.","It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things","you'll get some IBM power system that might be","a little bit faster, but not a whole lot.","So if I'm looking at this and saying","we need to be five times faster.","What do you do?","You can't just say make each thing faster.","As a developer you're making a trade-off,","I can put my effort into making this more efficient","or making it more fun.","And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons.","So there's some good judgment and trickery","that goes into the design of things.","But you can always just design a game","that will just not work well. (laughing)","I mean in the old days, games had to be","so precisely designed.","Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom.","You really can--"],"680":["Yeah, any crazy idea you had now you could probably make","a pretty good video game out of it.","Which is a wonderful, wonderful thing."],"681":["But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that","freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things,","so you can wind up having it be as responsive","and high quality as it needs to be."],"682":["You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits","to what we can do with virtual reality?","Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today.","What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool.","People get an amazing response from it.","But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality."],"683":["Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics,","the visual side of things,","but we should at least tick off the other senses.","And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality","really doesn't have that aspect of touching things.","You can move your hands around, you can do everything","but its a disconnected experience because you know","you don't have an actual solidity there.","And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology.","Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited","about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant","vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics","and make it feel like we're touching the things","in the virtual world."],"684":["Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that","is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization,","we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function,","to make it sound like its in different places.","But usually we just use this one kind of generic,","here's your average human, HRTF function.","Its possible, that of course, if you are right","in the average then its perfect for you.","But there's always people off to the extremes,","that it doesn't do a very good job at.","And there may be better ways to allow people to sample","their own perfect HRTF which can improve","the audio experience a lot.","It all comes down to all these trade-offs."],"685":["There was a huge concern about that at Oculus.","And the term internally that went around","was poisoning the well.","They were very, very concerned.","I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether","gear VR should even be done, because the worry was","if we let a product go out,","like gear VR that didn't have those things.","That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick,","made their eyes hurt, then they would be like","I'm never going to try VR again.","I tried it that time and it was terrible.","And there was legitimate arguments about whether","it was even a good idea to do that.","And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all","those things, but you can still do something","that's valuable for the user without it.","Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this."],"686":["Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about","what can we do, what's possible.","We think might be possible in the next couple of years.","But really at the professional level its more","the question of wisdom of what should we be doing."],"687":["As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things.","I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon,","here's my angular resolution that I'm improving.","I'm doing the color-space right.","But you can look not too far back where you say we","have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution,","but more people want to watch Youtube videos","at really bad early internet video speeds.","Where there are things that if you deliver","a value to people then these objective quantities","may not be the most important thing.","And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can","on lots of these things that make the experience better","in potentially every way or maybe just for videos","or for different things.","I don't think that its necessary.","I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles","on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't","even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded.","And I think its a lovely aesthetic.","I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing.","While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna","be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness.","And you've got aliasing everywhere,","and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic.","While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds","where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things","with lighting, but they look and they feel good.","And you can buy that you're in that place.","And you want to know what's around that monolith over there."],"688":["The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics","people chase photo-realistic form for a long time.","And basically, we've achieved it.","Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet","path traced rays at things,","you can generate photo-realistic views.","And we understand the light really well.","Of course it still takes a half hour per frame","like it always has, or more, to render the different things.","So its an understood problem and given infinite computing","power we could be doing that in virtual reality.","However, a point that I've made to people in recent years","is that, we are running out of More's Law.","Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum","structures or whatever--"],"689":["But if we just wind up following the path that we're on,","we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna","get 50 times more powerful than we are right now.","We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication.","So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying","back into optimization, start buying back into thinking","a bit more creatively.","Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to","that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees","just by waiting for computing to be advanced.","If we want this to be something used by a billion people","then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable."],"690":["You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic","case where you want to be able to have your synthetic","fantasy world where everybody is a creature","that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably.","But of course we've got, you know we still","don't do people well simulated.","That's a hard problem, we've been beating","our heads against it for a long time.","I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet","on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years.","Because it is going to take a lot of AI.","Its going to take a lot of machine-learning,","where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting","all the micro-expressions that people do.","Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made","and run it through some enormous learner","that's going to figure out how to make people realistic."],"691":["I'm still a believer that the magic's out there.","We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to","happen upon the formula.","I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic."],"692":["So VR right now is pretty amazing.","When you look at it its things that you haven't seen.","But we are just getting started.","The next five years both technologically and creatively","are going to really take this medium someplace","that you've never imagined."],"693":["Yes, its simple.","Its like a video game except it feels like","you're in the video game."],"694":["Or in Minecraft."],"695":["Yeah."],"696":["No."],"697":["Uh, three?"],"698":["Yeah, so my understanding of what latency is,","is its basically the time delay","between the rendering at different points."],"699":["The latency is, in my opinion, the most important part","of VR, because if you have that offset your body is","no longer immersed and you getting that motion sickness","which can pull a lot of people out of the experience."],"700":["It really is a testament to this kind of technology","and how its developing and how over time its gonna just be,","you're gonna be able to pack more pixel density in those","displays and its gonna get a lot more immersive."],"701":["Just the hardware.","Old games were ran off of 8 bit","and that's all the data you could have."],"702":["Yeah, a lot of freedom."],"703":["That's very interesting."],"704":["That kinds of notes back to Realism in our history","and how Realism was a response to Romanticism.","And Realism was meant to capture the mundane,","everyday lives of individuals and not idealize","any of their activities in any way.","And I think that that's really important","for virtual reality.","I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind","of our technology to go through."],"705":["So I've tried the demos, at VRLA there's one that has","waves, like audio waves I believe, that come up","and then you can put your hands through that and feel","the waves whenever you're supposed to be feeling bubbles","or any kind of force field or something.","And those are pretty interesting.","I've seen some pretty interesting things that you can do","with audios, you can cut down a lot of the storage I guess","and the power that you would need in order to power a huge","scene, you can just mimic the sounds of those scenes","actually being there and they're not actually.","For example, a professor at USC would have the sound of","a train drive by without actually rendering the sound.","And you would feel like you're deeply immersed in this world","without having to have such an expensive scene","built around you.","So I think those are pretty significant."],"706":["You know, with display and with resolution, its one","of those things where if people have one bad experience","they kind of, oh well everything else.","Its really difficult to build trust again with people","who haven't done VR before but its easy to break off","that trust when they have a bad experience."],"707":["Right, I'm very excited to see how filmmakers tackle","creating content and those things.","Especially if they're experienced with traditional medium."],"708":["That's one of the things we're trying to figure out,","from an artist and storytelling perspective, what are","the things that will make this meaningfully different","from what we're used to, like a television on our wall.","And we've been finding a lot of things, aspects","of virtual reality that very much do that in my opinion.","Things that allow you to feel presence, first and foremost,","where you get lost, and you have to remind yourself,","this isn't actually happening.","And things that ultimately allow you","to embody other characters.","Things where you can actually change your","own self-perception and play with neuro-plasticity","and teach yourself things that are bizarre and unique."],"709":["We did a project called Life of Us,","which was exactly that mindset.","We were let's embrace low-poly aesthetic","and just simple vertex shading.","And we ended up realizing, you can embody","these various creatures and transform yourself.","And when you do that with co-presence of another creature,","another human, it makes for a totally magical journey.","You don't even think for a second, you actually dismiss","the whole idea of photo-realism","and embrace that reality for what it is.","I think it actually helps put you at ease a little bit."],"710":["Or bandwidth, or streaming."],"711":["And there's constantly novel UX innovations.","Like Google Earth, where the kind of elimination of","your periphery as you zoom in and move.","And also, giving you the user action to decide","where you're going and looking.","I'm constantly seeing people coming up with ways to break","from the paradigms of actual reality and then introduce","mechanisms that work very well."],"712":["Absolutely, there are these crucial thresholds","where you pass a technological hurdle and all of a sudden","that unlocks a whole world of creative potential.","But I think, to your point very much, we need to solve","the actual human and social challenges and turn those","into opportunities to figure out","how this technology fits into our lives."],"713":["You can imagine the utility behind this for creating a world","or you can imagine the power of a story that would be told","to you in this context.","And a lot of it is just picking those, putting them together","in a meaningful way and then crafting something","that's really bigger and intentional.","But I've now been joining with real people","in virtual reality.","I think we also have different levels of connection.","Like the audio side is leaps and bounds above in terms","of the nuance and personality and humanity.","When I hear people laughing and joking","and really enjoying something.","Soon we'll get into that.","We're in macro-gestureland,","where I can wave and say thumbs-up.","But when we get into micro-gestures and actually getting","a sense of facial reactions and other things I think","then we'll have a really incredibly rewarding time,","spending time with each other."],"714":["Hi, I'm Varoujan Gorjian, I'm a Research Astronomer","at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.","I've been challenged today to talk","about once concept at five different levels","of increasing complexity.","Today we're going to be talking about black holes.","A basic definition of a black hole is","that it's a lot of mass crammed into a very tiny volume,","such that the escaped velocity is the speed of light."],"715":["So have you ever heard of something called a black hole?"],"716":["Well, it has to do with, a lot with gravity,","do you know what gravity is?"],"717":["It's what keeps us on the earth."],"718":["The reason we're not just flying off the earth is","because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up,","it comes back down, so that's why","when we're walking on the earth,","we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity,","and it keeps us down."],"719":["The main thing about black hole to remember is","that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down,","the black hole pulls you in, as well.","Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--"],"720":["I'm holding it tight to show you","then when you're trying to pull it,","a black hole will really hold onto it with its gravity."],"721":["Yeah.","The main thing is that if something falls","into a black hole, it can never get out, it's--"],"722":["Oh, if the earth rolls into it?"],"723":["It would be bad, we wouldn't be able to get out."],"724":["It's never, not likely to happen, no."],"725":["Well, yeah, definitely in movies, yeah."],"726":["Yeah, exactly."],"727":["The black hole will sort","of stretch you out as you're falling in."],"728":["Yeah."],"729":["So what do you think about black holes?"],"730":["So tell me, what do you know about black holes?"],"731":["You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it.","Basically you have a star,","at the core its generating energy,","which is countering the pressure","of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity.","Once it can't generate that energy anymore,","the core collapses, once the core is collapsing,","it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing,","and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole.","You have enough mass in the volume,","such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light,","once light can't escape, hence the black part. (laughs)","But that's the thing, is that just","because there's an intense amount","of gravity very close to a black hole,","things don't start behaving differently.","And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like,","if you point a vacuum cleaner at something,","it's just gonna suck everything in--"],"732":["Right, you will feel the gravitational pull,","and it'll redirect you in some way,","and if you're far enough way,","it's just like you're very far away","from the sun, or something else.","If you're close enough, it will divert your path more,","if you're close enough still, then you will get","what are called tidal forces, where the difference between,","for example, if you're standing next to a black hole,","the difference in gravity between your feet","and your head actually becomes significant.","Next time you see a science fiction movie,","if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught","in the gravitation field of a black hole,","and we're gonna fall in, it's like,","no, no, just, if you're far enough away,","just thrust a little bit this way,","and then you'll slingshot around the black hole."],"733":["I wouldn't call them educational,","but the movie Interstellar actually had,","as one of the people involved in both writing it,","and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne,","who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team","that detected gravitational waves,","and just won a Nobel Prize for it.","So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible,","so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples","of getting black holes right."],"734":["It's, there're multiple theories,","there's observational evidence,","more than some other theories that are really feeding","into this because now we have the instrumentation,","both in X-rays and infrared, in particular,","because we don't have a direct optical line","of sight to the center of our galaxy","because there's just a lot of dust in the way.","But the infrared can penetrate the dust,","the X-rays can penetrate the dust,","the radio can penetrate all of that dust,","so by combining all of these different wavelengths,","people are really coming to a point","of okay, how is this happening,","by looking at different wavelengths of light,","we can get a better sense, but they're still working","on the theory, it's not all done."],"735":["So far, what do you know about black holes?"],"736":["So we've been, we've had, now,","effectively two different ways","of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which","is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory,","which is where, getting the ripples in space time,","coming off of the merging of black holes.","The other one that you're mentioning is actually called","the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves","to actually image the event horizon,","that region where light cannot escape","from the black hole at the center of our galaxy,","which I know they're working on it right now.","It's an amazing thing,","but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole.","LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence","of the merging of black holes.","The critical part has been, like,","for the super massive black hole at the center","of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it,","and we've measured the mass, so that way,","so if you look at a spinning black hole,","it actually fundamentally alters the emission","that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it.","These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries,","that is, you know, there's an X-ray member","of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays,","and it's really not very bright","in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always,","people are looking at these X-ray binaries."],"737":["For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA","in graduate school, I worked","with a professor named Matt Malkin who was,","gotten a lot of data observations","from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one","of my very first projects to work on, so any,","space-based observatories have been a really big advantage,","and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope.","In addition to that, then there's other people","who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes,","NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that.","It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories,","as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere","from X-ray observations, not done by me,","but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical,","and infrared, particularly, those are the ones","that I've been most involved with."],"738":["What got you interested in studying black holes?"],"739":["Which is, by the way, what, when I was just starting out","in graduate school, that was the hot new thing, so."],"740":["That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it,","and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my,","it was basically my second year of graduate school,","it was like, uh, this is not that simple."],"741":["You know, everybody's been just coming at it","from different wavelengths at the optical infrared,","and, but definitely the X-rays has been one","of those things where it's like, oh, finally."],"742":["It does seem to be that it may not even,","in parts, it may not be even connected","to this tiny, little torus at all","because part of the work that I did,","and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live","in different kinds of galaxies than type ones,","which should not in any way have to do","with something such a small scale.","They tend to be in smaller bulged,","SB and SC type spiral galaxies.","So there's something also having to do","with environment that gets you to be a type two,","and you can still maybe, timing wise,","but there's something else that's going on","on a larger scale because the type","of the AGN should not really correspond","to the host galaxy, but it seems to.","And that was one of the things","that we were finding out, and that was one","of the early little ideas that the,","individually, just as the torus model,","the unified model, can't explain everything","that we were observing at the time.","But it is one of those things that it's,","they're super luminous, they're all over the place,","and we don't have a really good picture of it,","which makes it exciting to study."],"743":["Oh, that makes sense, but it's always","so difficult to get that."],"744":["So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it","from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly","in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and","study the environment around the super massive black holes,","not as close as where the X-rays are coming from,","but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona","that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk,","and the dust that's further out.","And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things","that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long,","once you've got this sort of pulse","that's generated close to the black hole,","it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths","to see that the accretion disk lights up","in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up","from the X-ray, and then later on,","the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it,","and emits it in the infrared.","And so that, I love that, the ability","to exchange time for resolution,","because these structures are so far away","that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough","where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk,","or the dust distribution around--"],"745":["Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z,","zero is, we're assuming that it's something,","you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close","to the event horizon of the black hole,","but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays,","to really figure out those kinds of things.","But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona,","and are re-scattered, and up, energized,","and then they start illuminating the accretion disk,","it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time,","when the optical, if it gets, you know,","brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter","and fainter, two weeks later,","then the dust is two light weeks away from that.","So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging,","so we don't get the two dimensional,","or even three dimensional one.","And then we've done it now, of course,","we have better telescopes, there was a project","where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope","and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory,","which had optical and ultraviolet,","and then from ground base, we did optical,","and then from space we did it","with Spitzer and the infrared.","So you could actually see this bright flash go off","in a nearby AGN called NGC5548,","and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk,","as all that light is falling onto it,","and then eventually you hit the,","the, further away, where the dust is,","and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared.","So we got basically a structure,","and you just, you see this flashbulb go off,","and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure."],"746":["So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius,","and you see it at, and it tells you,","depending on what kind of dust it is,","and it's actually one of the problems","for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies","of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your,","by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries","that are also emitting X-rays,","which make our lives difficult.","But they're also in black holes,","when it's this really interesting sort of both,","it's great, but ugh, it's also a source","of noise for those of us who are trying","to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies."],"747":["It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy,","but not be able to separate all these,","four million solar mass black hole creating,","next to, how massive, it's like two","to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?"],"748":["Which is great, although it still doesn't help us","in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions","to billions solar mass black holes came to be.","But it's, at least we're building up,","or hopefully that at some point,","and by understanding these lower mass,","how these lower mass black holes came to be,","then we can see where there are a large scale number","of mergers can potentially give us this,","or you really need something, other,","another corridor to fundamentally get us something","that's a million solar masses, you know,","on the minimum side, but definitely,","you know, we've gotten those which are billion.","So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes","to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those","in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe,","when you get quasars at really high red shifts,","so they're really early on."],"749":["And this goes to the idea","that you don't have a core balance,","that a supernova with a black hole as its final result,","actually never has any kind of expulsion,","that it all just goes. (imitates sucking)"],"750":["Which was one idea, but again, it's,","I'll leave this to your theoreticians,","I think there are problems with that, as well.","I call it job security. That's right.","(both laugh)","We have a lot of things about black holes,","both in terms of their formation,","or even how they exist as they are,","and how they're interacting with their environment","that we're still not understanding."],"751":["What is a black hole?"],"752":["No, not at all."],"753":["What?"],"754":["Nice."],"755":["Why do you hold it so tight?"],"756":["I got it."],"757":["What about the earth? What if it rolls into it--"],"758":["Yeah."],"759":["So it could never happen?"],"760":["Only in movies, right?"],"761":["Yeah, but it's not real because it's just pictures of it."],"762":["What if I went in there?"],"763":["It'll, like, stretch my body out?"],"764":["What?"],"765":["It's kind of dangerous."],"766":["Well, I know they're created when stars,","once they start growing, it doesn't,","it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward."],"767":["But no, the wind, the pull isn't,","if you're not close enough, it doesn't work."],"768":["So are there any movies that actually do,","like, get space right?"],"769":["So it's, I'm assuming it's hard to,","like, detect a black hole, besides if it's,","if things are close enough that they're being pulled in,","so it's basically a theory?"],"770":["I never knew beforehand how hard it was","to get actual data of the black holes itself,","first of all, they're dark, and, like,","they're so far away, it's almost impossible just","to get a good image of them.","They were discussing a project in","which multiple radio telescopes of some sort, like, are,","like, pinpointed all across, from Greenland","to South America, and, like, and they're trying to","get an image of","the black hole in the center","of our galaxy because, as opposed","to just recording its impact","on the surrounding stars and planets."],"771":["What sort of technology and, like,","I guess tools have you been using","in your studies, or, like, just in general,","in the study of black holes?"],"772":["The way I got really interested","in this field is I actually first came","to Caltech as a summer student, and I started working","in this research group called the NuSTAR Group.","Right now I'm doing my PhD in the field","of active galactic nuclei,","which are the most luminous compact objects in the universe,","and it's because of the extreme accretion","that we're seeing onto these super massive black holes.","We don't have such a simple picture,","that this central black hole is surrounded","by this donut shaped torus of material,","and that all these different classes of AGN simply arise","from a viewing angle effect of this torus,","as a very oversimplified geometry, and this--"],"773":["Exactly."],"774":["It isn't."],"775":["And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range","of the spectrum, we can elucidate more","about the circumnuclear geometry,","and there's just been so much progress made","with all these new spectral models","that we use to fit AGN spectra,","and the different types of classes of AGN,","like type one and type two are believed","to be just a viewing angle effect","of seeing this torus at different angles."],"776":["Yeah, and I think, you know,","pushing towards the future, that, like,","this whole multi-messenger era, and like,","you know, utilizing all the different wavelength telescopes","that we can is really the way to go.","We cannot just build up a picture purely","from X-rays alone, or purely from infrared,","and, you know, I think there should be increased effort","to try and have more coordinated observations","with the different telescopes, like NuSTAR--"],"777":["It is, and it's difficult to even just coordinate,","you know, soft X-ray and hard X-ray telescopes together,","like, getting, you know, time for both simultaneous,","you know, say, Chandra observations,","and NuSTAR observations, or (mumbles) and NuSTAR.","It's a difficult thing, but, you know,","I think we really need to get a clear picture,","to be looking at wavelengths, of course."],"778":["So how do you do your observations","in optical and infrared?"],"779":["So do you get dimensions of the disk out of that?"],"780":["So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?"],"781":["We have the same problem,","we can't see the actual black hole","underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries."],"782":["The X-ray binaries, yeah, so they're,","no, they're typically like 10 solar masses, so from three,","you know, that's the smallest one you can have is","from three solar masses, and then all the way up.","So that's where we have LIGO, and LIGO has now directly,","I mean, this was all theory before,","that we knew that this was gonna happen,","and never seen it before, so LIGO is now the first time","that we have been able to completely verify this theory,","that you can have black holes","and neutron stars merging together.","And so what happens in the case","of two neutron stars, when they merge together,","now suddenly they become heavier,","they become heavy enough to turn into a black hole.","And so the first of these events happened in August,","and what happened here is you had these two neutron stars","that spun around each other, and then they merged,","and then for a very short time, we are talking","about 100 milliseconds, or tens of 100 milliseconds,","it actually remained a neutron star, probably,","it was a hyper massive neutron star because it was spinning","so fast, it didn't collapse under its own weight.","But then, you know,","the angular momentum gets dissipated away from the object,","and then, at that point, it can't maintain its own weight,","and then it collapses, and turn into a black hole.","All this theory that we knew about is now finally being,","being validated."],"783":["Yeah, it is odd, it is very odd.","I mean, the other thing that's a little odd,","now we're going back to stellar mass black holes is,","so we look at a lot of supernova remnants,","and we, so we see them, we can only really see them","in our own galaxy, and so we have a lot","of supernova remnants, and so how we see them is,","you see the expelled mass from the star as it died,","so that creates an extended source, and then you look","for the compact object that was left behind.","And what's interesting is that you see,","you quite often see the neutron stars","because they pulse, so they're easy to see,","but so far, we've not found a single black hole","at the center of a supernova remnant.","And so, which is interesting, so you say,","you should see them, you know, you ought","to see some fallback, you know, you need some matter,","you need something, but no, never, not yet been detected."],"784":["Yeah, that might be, yeah."],"785":["I'm Donna Strickland.","I'm a professor at the University of Waterloo.","I study lasers and, in particular,","I like really high intensity lasers.","So a laser is a way to get light to actually just","be a single color, going in a single direction","all of the waves peaking at the same time","so that the intensity can get very high.","Today I've been challenged to explain lasers","and high intensity lasers at five different levels.","From a child, to a teenager, to a college student,","to a graduate student and finally to a colleague of mine."],"786":["So I was told that maybe science is","one of your favorite subjects at school.","Is that right?"],"787":["Have you actually studied light yet?"],"788":["Okay what have you learned so far about light?"],"789":["Oh really?","Oh excellent.","Well I'm somebody who studies lasers.","So what do you think about lasers?"],"790":["You haven't got to play with lasers.","So I brought one.","It's my friend's cat toy.","Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?"],"791":["Well one of the fun things people do with lasers,","the cat will try to grab that dot.","I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight.","I brought a cute little one.","So the question is, do you see any difference","between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?"],"792":["That's true, that laser's just a dot.","And so the other thing to notice though is that,","like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do!","But it seems awfully bright doesn't it?","And yet when, you know, you shine this down","and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?"],"793":["The laser.","So which one do you think's more powerful?"],"794":["[Donna] And yet it's not.","Isn't that amazing?"],"795":["One of the things that lasers are great for","is that because it's a directed beam,","we can actually put that light where we want the light to go","and sometimes you maybe just want to see","something around the corner and you can't see it.","But with a laser, you can actually","and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go.","You see it actually bending the corner?"],"796":["And that's because the light will go through this glass","and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend.","And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers,","the size of your hair."],"797":["So this obviously is much bigger than our hair.","Right?"],"798":["So this is just a demonstration.","If you have a laser like this, it actually","bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you","and you'll see it coming out the other end.","It hits these walls, it has to go around","and come out the other side.","You wanna play?","So is this the first time you've seen a laser","or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?"],"799":["You don't have a cat.","So you don't need a cat toy no.","Have you ever gone to a grocery store","and just scanned your objects over?"],"800":["Have you ever seen that maybe there's","a little bit of a red light when you do that?"],"801":["That's a laser.","We cut steel with them now.","We actually do surgery with lasers.","You know when some people have either scars","or birth marks that they don't want to see?","We can actually remove those with lasers now.","Never seen a laser light show?","When they light up the sky with","lasers, it's almost like fireworks."],"802":["Oh you got to see a shooting star?","Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there.","So what do you think about lasers?","You think they're fun?"],"803":["The green one.","And the next time you go to a grocery","store, take a peek at the red."],"804":["Okay."],"805":["Today we're here to talk about lasers.","So what do you think about lasers?"],"806":["Do you know anything about lasers?","What makes a laser special kind of light."],"807":["Do you even know maybe how to make a laser","that it would be strong enough to cut steel?"],"808":["Okay. [laughing]","So one of the things about lasers is,","if you've ever seen a laser beam,","you know it's very directed."],"809":["What is a laser made out of?","Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb.","Right?"],"810":["So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors.","Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special.","It has to be a type of material that can","store the energy in an excited state right?","It has to stay up there really energetic","and sit there for a while so that","when the light comes along,","it takes that energy and becomes stronger light","and then the mirror sends it back","and it does it again and again and again","and between these two mirrors, it makes","the light come out in a nice beam.","In a laser, it comes out as a single color.","They all come out with their waves at the same time.","Every wave peaks at the same time","which then makes it a giant wave","and it's this giant wave that","has a tremendous amount of power.","So it can do something like cutting steel.","But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor,","it's gray, it actually will absorb the light.","That's why the light, you don't see it because the","light isn't bouncing back or through it.","So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works.","So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail.","I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail","before into a piece of wood but the question is,","if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end","and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood.","We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end","and hope this would go in to the piece of wood."],"811":["That's right.","All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through","but then it can only basically come out","when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot.","And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with","but sometimes it is that force per unit area.","But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area","'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that","and see if we can get it pushed in.","See it doesn't really work does it?"],"812":["Well it depends.","So if you're cutting steel,","you need to have the nail.","You need to have it concentrated all of the light,","not going in all directions but you","need it into as small a point as possible.","And for that we use a lens.","For a lens, the light's coming down as a column,","you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way","as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel.","Okay so that force per unit area--"],"813":["Exactly.","You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy","not just in a small area but in the small volume","and so one of the other dimensions is time or length.","But with light, time and length are the same thing","because light always travels at the speed of light."],"814":["But if you send a one second long light pulse","out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse","is actually two thirds of the way to the moon.","It's 300,000 kilometers long.","So now, if you talk about light being","concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated.","The type of lasers I play with in my lab","will be no thicker than this piece of paper.","So we take that energy that might be","in three hundred thousand kilometers and we","squeeze it all the way down into just this","piece of paper and actually the beams","are more the size of this piece of paper","and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this","would be flying through the sky but we can't see them.","'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us","and they're infra red."],"815":["Exactly.","And so now, if we have light like","that that we wanna machine with.","I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here","and the light was coming down--"],"816":["Into a spot.","So here would be my light coming from my laser","and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down.","Hit a lens and it would have to focus down.","But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread","so concentrated this much.","Eventually it would be here, more concentrated.","But by the end, right at the focal spot,","that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has","been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper","and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer.","Because when this hits a piece of glass,","it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms","and there's nothing else for them","to do, they have to fly away.","So can you tell me what you learned","and maybe about the focusing of the light?"],"817":["So do you think that lasers are fun enough","to talk with your friends about or?"],"818":["[Donna] So you're a college student?"],"819":["[Donna] And what's your major?"],"820":["Excellent.","I got an engineering physics degree.","There you go, something in common.","We're here today talking about lasers.","So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?"],"821":["Okay.","As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things?","Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening.","So then the question is, what's so special","about making a light that's intense enough","to actually possibly blow things up?","Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer","and when the laser light comes in","and just smacks the electrons right off the atom.","And so the question really is how do you make that?","Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was","a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers","and we had short pulse lasers, we","couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers","and actually it was my supervisor and I","that figured the way around that and we got","something called chirped pulse amplification.","Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?"],"822":["Well I brought a little bit of a prop","to explain how chirped pulse amplification works.","Our short pulses are made of different colors.","So I've got a colored slinky here.","We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification","but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped.","The word chirped comes around because birds chirp.","When the birds are singing, the notes are actually","changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp.","The point is is that when all the light is","squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse.","And that's when it's a hammer because all","of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this","was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small,","then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate.","And so that was the laser hammer.","So we can't have that in the laser.","So the question is what could we do?","The fact that it's different colors","and different colors because of dispersion,","travel different speeds inside material.","So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber","but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got","that much in common with the glass atoms and so they","spend very little time interacting and they travel fast.","The red is going to start traveling faster than the green,","faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber,","next thing you know, you have a long pulse","and it's chirped from red at the","beginning to blue at the back.","And so the frequencies go hoo!","Like this okay?","So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse.","And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it,","we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it","because it's not all concentrated","and, after we amplify it, then we use something called","a compressor and we put all of the colors back together","and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse.","And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer.","When this laser pulse goes inside,","it smacks those electrons right off the atom."],"823":["Well a lot of lasers and when lasers","first came along, they were only single color.","Your cat toy, would only be a single color,","probably a red one and so that's just one color.","And one color means that it has to","really be there for the whole time.","One color is one wave length of light","and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on.","If you want a short pulse, you","actually have to have all the colors.","And if you can imagine that one point in time,","and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra.","When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they","sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes.","But when the conductor conducts them, they all play","different notes but, together, it's beautiful music.","So we have something in the laser called a mode locker","and it's like the conductor and it says go now.","And all the colors will start together but","some colors are long wave length and others are shorter.","So next thing you know, you have peaks","meeting valleys and they cancel each other.","And the more colors you can bring in, the faster","that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make."],"824":["The necklace is something that","was designed for my Nobel prize.","It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse.","So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications,","what have you learned about chirped pulses?"],"825":["[Donna] So I understand you're in grad school.","Where?"],"826":["And what are you studying?"],"827":["And what kind of laser do you use?"],"828":["Do you know a lot about lasers?","Or just about the laser that you use."],"829":["Okay.","So this is about high intensity lasers.","Not only how do you make them,","but what was really stopping them being made","in both cases is non linear optics.","We wanna do something that requires","a huge photon density application,","and so that's how come we came up with","chirped pulse amplification,","so that we could stretch the pulse,","safely amplify it, then compress it at the end,","and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end.","So what do you think the main difference is","between the continuous wave laser that you have","that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?"],"830":["And so we get the power with a lot less energy","'cause its power is energy per unit time.","So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison.","Can I just ask, 'cause you are using","the thermal process of it heating up,","but have you ever had the opportunity","to use laser tweezers?"],"831":["And twirl the motors or not twirl the motors?"],"832":["You haven't?","Okay."],"833":["So chirped pulse amplification took us sort of from,","we were at 10 to the 12, but when I was working","the 10 to the 12 sort of sat on a football sized field.","It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse.","And we brought it down to something we call","tabletop terawatt.","So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule","and one picosecond, so it could fit on a basic optical bench","like you would have in your lab.","We were able to take that up to,","I think the record is right around","somewhere between 10 to the 22","and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter.","So then in going forward, one of the holy grails","is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter?","So we still have six orders.","So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23.","So we've done 11 orders,","so you think six isn't so much harder.","I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over.","We need another Nobel Prize winning idea.","But if we get out there, that's where,","if you focus the intensity,","the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum."],"834":["Yes.","And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy","and watch the cell?","Or to ionize it?"],"835":["I don't know if people are working on that","because I'm not so much in the medical field,","but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility.","So after hearing about high intensity lasers,","can you think about next time you go back to the lab","and you're wondering how to do something in the lab","with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?"],"836":["That's true.","Thank you very much."],"837":["Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me.","So we go way back.","1991, the year I got married,","I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey,","to work with you in Livermore."],"838":["And stay there."],"839":["You could not convince me to stay, no."],"840":["And I've been talking sort of,","started with sort of what is a laser","through linear optics, non linear optics,","high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know,","we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit","of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter.","We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23","I think at this point.","But even if we get to 100 petawatts","and focus that down to a wavelength,","we're not at 10 to the 29.","So you're hoping to build the biggest laser."],"841":["At Rochester.","But we're still not gonna get to the Schwinger limit,","isn't that right?"],"842":["That's right, if you can do that, go for it."],"843":["Okay, but that's kind of cheating.","That's not getting to 10 to the 29.","If you could do it with 100% efficiency","that's all we need."],"844":["That's the Nobel Prize winning idea though","if we can come up with it."],"845":["We have to get into entertainment.","When is the high intensity laser gonna","get into entertainment so then there's real money?"],"846":["No."],"847":["I don't like science fiction."],"848":["So we can either cheat by doing laser accelerating","and going into that rest frame."],"849":["And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit,","we're not up to that kind of acceleration,","so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea."],"850":["Or we need, going around and giving my talks now,","I show how we're plateauing.","I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up,","but we're sort of starting to plateau again","and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea.","And so do you think it's on the horizon?","Do you see anything out there that really says,","oh yeah that's a good way to go?","'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right?","We can't stay in the visual."],"851":["Okay."],"852":["And right across the beam.","Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge?","'Cos it's not like our beams are","as perfect as we like to think they are."],"853":["Okay so there's a lot of us working around","the world on these high intensity lasers and so,","what do you think the real fun is?","What do you see the real excitement being?"],"854":["So it is amazing, the parallels.","And optics is used everywhere.","We're gonna possibly take over from CERN,","we'll just do high energy physics with lasers,","we're looking at gravity waves with lasers,","we wanna do black holes with lasers,","we wanna machine with lasers,","we wanna do medicine with lasers.","It's everywhere.","And now, with the Nobel prize, people are hearing","more about it so they know lasers are everywhere."],"855":["There you go."],"856":["Okay.","And only one Canadian.","There you go!","[laughing]"],"857":["Today was fun, I got to explain the work I do at all levels.","It's always fun for me to talk to elementary school","students because they bring such enthusiasm.","With a student who's already started to learn optics,","to a graduate student and finally my own colleague","where we can really get into a huge conversation","about what's the future of this field.","Electronics was the technology for the 20th century","and it brought us the transistor.","Electrons don't move nearly as fast as light and so,","trust me photonics will take us","where we wanna go in this century."],"858":["Yes."],"859":["Yes."],"860":["So we learned how to actually light up a light bulb."],"861":["I don't know--"],"862":["No."],"863":["Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot."],"864":["[Harmoni] The laser."],"865":["The laser."],"866":["Yes."],"867":["Yes."],"868":["Yeah."],"869":["Yes."],"870":["I don't have a cat or--"],"871":["Yes."],"872":["Yes."],"873":["Well I saw a shooting star before."],"874":["Yes they're very cool.","I like the one where you did the green one."],"875":["Okay."],"876":["I think they're pretty cool.","They show up in a lot of my favorite books and movies.","Like Star Wars or just a bunch of","different sci-fi movies and books."],"877":["All I really know is from sci-fi books and movies","and like the factory cutting lasers","that they use to cut steel and stuff."],"878":["No."],"879":["Like what are they made out of?"],"880":["So it's a beam?"],"881":["Because it needs to be centered so","it can more easily just go in."],"882":["So the laser needs ultimately many things.","It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually","penetrate and then it needs--"],"883":["So it's kind of like a magnifying glass?","Like it magnifies the light down to a point?"],"884":["Exactly."],"885":["There'd be like little concentrated beams of light","just flying everywhere?"],"886":["It funnels into--"],"887":["Well what I learned, lasers they aren't like particles.","They're more like a super concentrated beam of light","that can be any color.","They get really concentrated and that's what makes them","lasers and that's why they cut things and break things","because they just move the electrons out of the way."],"888":["Of course I'm gonna have to share","something about my experience.","Learning about lasers with an expert like you."],"889":["Yes."],"890":["I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math.","I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering."],"891":["Not yet.","I'm really hoping that we will.","I think it's super interesting just the field","in general because I really do enjoy examining","all the calculations and being able to do","a little bit more of the math side of physics."],"892":["Vaguely."],"893":["So the laser hammer that you were describing with","other types of lasers and the one in","the chirped is it still the same premise?"],"894":["What's the pendant?"],"895":["I learned that it all stretches, which is super cool,","because red moves the fastest","and so it kinda tugs around blue.","It really threw me off just how fast.","It's hard to imagine things happening that fast.","And I also learned how many of the things","that I know are lasers.","Like how many of the things that I've been looking for,","like, the answers to, it is in lasers."],"896":["At NYU."],"897":["I'm studying soft matter physics,","which involves the physics of squishy stuff.","We make microswimmers in the laboratory","and we drive them with a laser."],"898":["We use a 10 watt laser, it's a fiber laser."],"899":["Not a lot, just a little bit."],"900":["I feel like the continuous laser","delivers power at a continuous rate,","whereas you want all that power to be delivered","in a really, really short time with your amplification."],"901":["I have, yeah.","We use optical tweezers to trap particles in solution."],"902":["No, I haven't worked with that."],"903":["So I was always curious, how much further,","like what higher power can we go now?"],"904":["We could probably use this to drive chemical reactions","at a very, very specific spot.","Like if we want to target just a single cell in the body."],"905":["I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to,","let's say destroy one cell,","like a tumor cell or something like that.","So that the neighboring areas are not affected","but just the cell burns."],"906":["I think short pulses might help in my experiment","in the sense that if I drive my swimmers","with a continuous wave as opposed to a pulsed wave,","maybe a continuous wave would heat up the sample too much","and a pulse laser would deliver power","exactly where I need it so that I could","run my experiment longer."],"907":["Thank you, Donna.","It was really nice to meet you."],"908":["Hello Donna, good to see you."],"909":["I remember very much and how hard it was","to convince you to travel across the country","and work at the lab."],"910":["And stay there.","[laughing]"],"911":["I couldn't convince you to stay."],"912":["But you were there long enough to make a big impression","and get some good work done."],"913":["Yes."],"914":["So just a little bit of back history again.","After you demonstrated CPA, I was intrigued by","how powerful could we make lasers?","And then how lasers are wonderful","because they allow you to take energy","and compress it in space and time.","So having high P power is something,","it's been a motivator for me for a long time.","And so we at the university are making proposals","to build two 25 petawatt lasers, maybe 30 petawatt lasers.","We'll use them to be able to get combined power","of over 10 to the 24 watts per square center.","Still far from the Schwinger limit.","But we have a trick.","We're going to use one of these petawatt lasers","to make an electron beam.","And this electron beam will be relativistic.","We actually think we could make electron beam,","maybe even 100s of GeV up to TeV,","which would be another Nobel Prize if we did that."],"915":["And then we will shine that laser onto that electron beam,","and the electron's rest frame, we beat the Schwinger limit."],"916":["That's why I wanna cheat."],"917":["Because again, if we're able to do this,","with ways I can see today.","Right?","I can see us doing it today,","by just exploiting what we already know","and taking it to a limit,","then that would be a real motivator, I think,","to be able to even take these techniques further.","Cheating's not the right exact word","as taking advantage of relativity.","Take advantage of all physics not just optical physics.","So that's why we wanna do it this way."],"918":["Yes, yes, well we have Star Trek,","we had the photon torpedoes.","I always thought they actually knew what you were doing,","there's a photon torpedo.","Have you ever seen that in--"],"919":["[Michael] Oh."],"920":["Oh no, Star Trek had photon torpedoes","and they showed bursts of light about this long.","It was a CPA, it was a few nanosecond pulse.","Didn't say how much energy it carried,","and you could see it.","I don't know what it was gathering off of","but you could see it, so it was a great thing."],"921":["Yes."],"922":["Absolutely."],"923":["So actually there's a potential ways","of doing it with optical or near optical radiation.","And there's been a lot of work done in the defense","department and so on, how do I combine laser beams together?"],"924":["And make them act as one coherent source.","So one of the things that we'll be doing","with our two petawatts, we're going to see","if we can actually combine them into a 50.","If you can do that, you can begin","to imagine doing this with many lasers.","Many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about.","So one could possibly see an exawatt from that.","People have been able to combine 10s of lasers together","for a coherent source so you have to be able","to phase lock them, you have to be able to make","their phases be exactly connected","and related and be able, as they propagate through all","the different optical components, whatever it may be--"],"925":["So that's right so you have to have the aperture size,","you have to have them phase","locked across the entire aperture.","Which will be a great challenge","and people have done it, again, with small lasers.","The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture.","So we'll begin to start looking at this.","And actually wavelength control and then be able","to adaptive optics other ways which","you can control the uniformity of the phase","is something that's been developed in lots of ways now.","For defense applications, for science applications.","So we will do our best to","make use of all these technologies.","Lasers I think have progressed so much.","Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market","for it, there were so many different applications for that."],"926":["I remember when","laser was first demonstrated 1960,","what could we do with this?","We already got light.","Now we can't live without lasers.","My cell phone, that is in my","pocket, has billions of transistors.","How is that made?","With lasers.","All of the greatest circuitry is done with lasers.","Actually now it's using x-rays,","made from laser heated matter.","That came out of the laser fusion program."],"927":["[Michael] I couldn't agree with you more","and you winning the Nobel prize has","been an inspiration to lots of people.","Only three women have won the Nobel prize in physics","and only one educated in the United States.","You."],"928":["And I use that every place."],"929":["Hi, I'm Sean Carroll.","I'm a theoretical physicist","here at the California Institute of Technology.","I've been challenged to explain dimensions","to five different levels.","The idea of a dimension, sometimes in pop culture","is misunderstood, like there's an extra place","you can go, a mystical dimension or something like that.","To a physicist or a mathematician,","a dimension is just the direction you can go in.","Up down, left right, forward backward.","To you and me, we think there's three dimensions around us,","but then physicists start talking about extra dimensions.","How can you hide them?","Where might they be?","I'm hopeful that we're learn something at each level."],"930":["We're gonna talk about some science.","Do you like science?"],"931":["Oh, very good.","You've come to the right place.","So we're gonna think about physics.","Have you heard the word physics before?","Do you know what that is?"],"932":["What's your idea what physics is?"],"933":["Okay.","I just think of physics as the study of everything.","What stuff is, what stuff does.","So today we're gonna talk about space,","and in particular the idea of dimensions.","Have you heard about dimensions?"],"934":["3D printing, good."],"935":["But do you know what 3D means?"],"936":["Three dimensional, as opposed to,","what is ordinary printing?"],"937":["What do you say when something is one dimensional?","What's an example of something that's one dimensional?"],"938":["A line is the perfect example"],"939":["Because it's one thing that's straight, right?"],"940":["So here's some toys.","We're gonna build some dimensions, right?","So what would you say about this?"],"941":["Exactly.","It's not really one dimensional, right?"],"942":["And how would you find yourself,","like if someone said where are you,","could you use some words or ideas","to say where you are on that line?"],"943":["But here's what I want you to think about.","If I say I'm at this point on the line,","I could translate that into saying","I'm at the three centimeter point,","if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point,","the five centimeter point, right?"],"944":["So every point, every location on our little line--"],"945":["Has its own unit, has one number."],"946":["We need one number to tell you where we are.","That's one dimension.","That's what it means to be one dimensional.","I only need to tell you one number","to figure out where we are."],"947":["There you go. Exactly.","We're gonna build a little two dimensional space.","You wanna do it?","You wanna do the honors here?","Why don't you put those two lines together?"],"948":["Exactly, there you go."],"949":["I think you should be in this chair","and you should be explaining this to me.","You're much better at this than I am."],"950":["So those are the dimensions.","That's how we think about dimensions.","Remember, we just needed one number","to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers","to find ourselves on the plane."],"951":["There you go."],"952":["So, do you think we could have more than three dimensions?"],"953":["Well, as far as we know."],"954":["This is why physicists think about things","we don't know about.","We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions","you've never seen. Yeah.","That are tinier than atoms.","So, okay.","So what have you learned?","What do you know about dimensions now?","How do you think about dimensions","in a slightly different way than you did before?"],"955":["Yeah, do you think you'd be excited","if physicists said that they found","extra dimensions of space?"],"956":["I think so.","I think you're right.","All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying,","learn a lot of math and physics","and help us discover new dimensions some day.","Does that sound like a fun idea?"],"957":["Do you like science?","Is that something you think about?"],"958":["[Sean] What kind of science?"],"959":["All right, you're in the wrong place.","[laughs] We're not gonna be talking","about biology or computer science.","So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions.","Do you know what dimension is?","How we would define dimensions?"],"960":["Right, you know the difference between like one dimension","two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera.","So let's do a little experiment here.","So there's one dimension.","I'll give that to you.","Now, here's your task.","I'm going to give you another dimension,","and I'm gonna ask hold those two things","at right angles to each other.","It's easy to do.","Yeah, so there's no trick here."],"961":["I'm not trying to fool you here. Okay.","Now this is going to be slightly trickier.","I'm going to give you this.","I want you to hold all three of them","at right angles to all the others","at the same time."],"962":["There you go.","So what that's doing is when you had just two","that was describing a two dimensional plane, right?","Like the two things pick out a plane,","the three things pick out all three dimensional space.","I'm gonna give you one more,","and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one","so that it's at a right angle to all the other three","at the same time."],"963":["All right, now I am tricking you.","It can't be done.","Yeah. Right?","You can't do it.","So we just experimentally proved","that space is three dimensional.","That's sort of what it means to be three dimensional,","that there are three different directions you can move in","and there's not four or five or six directions","you can move in."],"964":["There you go.","Three dimensional space, right?"],"965":["[Sean] So, have you thought about using coordinates","in three dimensions?"],"966":["There you go.","[laughing]"],"967":["That's right.","So that's exactly what these would be.","Have you heard that there are other coordinate systems","other than XYX?"],"968":["Well, we could also say how far we are","away from the center, just the distance.","And then the angle that our little line makes","with let's say the X axis."],"969":["So that's a different way of giving you two numbers","and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates.","It's a different coordinate system.","What we want to do as physicists is look","for extra dimensions.","Can you imagine, can you think of any way","that there could be extra dimensions?"],"970":["Time.","Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time","as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing","that we could talk about all by itself.","But what about space?","What about the solar system?","Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was","in the sky, do you know how we do that?"],"971":["It's exactly the same thing as latitude and longitude","but we put coordinates on the sky."],"972":["So astronomers call them right ascension and declination,","which are two terrible words,","but basically you've seen on the globe","where you draw latitude and longitude,","what it looks like."],"973":["[Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange","kind of thing, right?"],"974":["So you can define something as, well you know,","how high above a certain location on earth it is,","but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun","so we have to define separate celestial coordinates."],"975":["We don't know.","You know, the optimistic view is that there are six,","but the thing is, some of them might be","really, really, really, really, really small,","like way too small for us to ever see."],"976":["And some of them might be medium sized","that hopefully we can see."],"977":["Absolutely right.","And this is sort of the state of uncertainty","that physicists are stuck living in."],"978":["You know, honestly out there, if you go out","onto campus and talk to the physicists,","half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist,","and half of them say no, that's just nonsense."],"979":["[Sean] We really don't know."],"980":["Okay, after all this."],"981":["Someone comes up to you on the street and says","what's a dimension?"],"982":["That's right, and you know, if they're still bugging you","you can just like give them some sticks","and ask them to put them together."],"983":["[Sean] And that would shut them up."],"984":["Where do you go to school and what do you study?"],"985":["Oh, math and physics, okay.","What kind of physicist do you want to be?","Do you know?"],"986":["Usually if it's math and physics,","you end up as a theoretical physicist, right?"],"987":["Not an experimental one.","So, our theme here today is dimensions.","So this is great that you have some math background","because mathematicians think about dimensions","in a different way."],"988":["So how would you explain to your friends","who are not math and physics majors,","like what is a dimension, yourself?"],"989":["Mm-hmm."],"990":["That's exactly right, and so you've heard","of spacetime--"],"991":["[Sean] Being four dimensional, right?"],"992":["Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me,","because of course you have space,","which is three dimensional, you have time","which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional.","But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone","that that was a sensible way to talk","until really relativity.","This is the crucial thing, right?","Is that what Einstein realized is that","sure there's both time and space, but how we divide","spacetime into time and space can be different","for different people, and really there's a real sense","in which four dimensional spacetime","is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space.","And I think to really explain this","we're gonna need a blackboard."],"993":["Let's bring one in.","All right.","The thing about relativity","is that they really want you to think","of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right?","It's kind of like space.","It's not just three dimensions of space","and one dimension of time."],"994":["Why?","This is a very good question.","So, let's just start with space, right?","We know a little bit about space.","So here's my simple minded way of drawing space","two dimensions, because that's how many","I can draw on the blackboard.","Let's say X and Y.","And what is special about space, there's many things,","but one is that if I have a curve or a path","between two points, there's a distance","that you can calculate, right?","And the distance between those two points","doesn't depend on your coordinates.","It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates","or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever.","I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this","between those two points, and if I were a person","walking on that curve, I would have an odometer","with me maybe, and I would know, you would know,","even without having done that,","this path is always gonna be longer than that path.","There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem","that tells you what the shortest distance path is.","That's the point.","The physical-ness of what is real","is the distance along a certain curve.","So spacetime is like that.","That's why it is useful to think about spacetime."],"995":["So let me draw spacetime.","Here's how we usually draw it.","I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed","in this one direction, and this is time, okay?","So if you're a little person","and you started some event, so you start,","you're located somewhere in space,","somewhere in the three coordinates of space,","and whether you like it or not, you're moving","through spacetime just by getting older."],"996":["When people ask me can you travel through time?","I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future","and here I am, a day later.","So that's just this.","Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not.","So what Einstein says is look, I can travel","through spacetime in different ways,","like I could hop in a rocket ship","and fly out and then fly back,","and then I could meet you there.","So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?"],"997":["And it's almost exactly like the space story.","The space story says there's a distance,","distance is different along different curves.","Einstein says there's something that measures","the length of these curves,","and we call it the proper time.","It is literally the time that you would read","on your wristwatch."],"998":["Well kind of.","What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing","as fundamental, like there's the universe's time,","this big letter T that might tell you how old","the universe is, but then every individual","has a clock with them, and they measure their own time","depending on how they're moving through the universe."],"999":["And the crucial difference is","that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind","and sat in their chair,","and this person who zoomed out there."],"1000":["There is what we call a metric on spacetime,","and when we talk about Euclidean space","versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something,","that's a different metric.","And spacetime has its own metric","which says the following thing,","that the path between two events in spacetime","that is a straight line, will always be the longest time."],"1001":["[Sean] That's the difference."],"1002":["So when Einstein had this idea,","oh gravity could be related to the curvature","of spacetime, he did some equations,","so he got it, that's a long story,","we'll put that aside.","What he figured out was that rather than gravity","living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation","of the curvature of spacetime","so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon,","they cause a gravitational field,","they're actually warping the spacetime around them.","They're giving it a different geometry."],"1003":["Yeah, exactly.","If you had a sheet that was originally flat,","and you set a marble on it,","it would go in a straight line,","but then if you put something on it","so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected."],"1004":["Einstein says that gravity is just like that."],"1005":["But there are no straight lines,","because spacetime itself is curved.","So do you think if you had to explain relativity","what would you say?"],"1006":["Yeah, that's right.","And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board","where how those two people in the train and on the ground","would divide spacetime up differently","to space and time."],"1007":["[Sean] Yeah.","I learned a lot.","[Sean] It's a lot of fun stuff to talk about."],"1008":["So observational cosmology, so like what do you look at?"],"1009":["I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions","a little bit."],"1010":["Well I'm thinking about the idea","that there might be more than three dimensions of space.","What is your impression of theoretical physicists","who think about things like extra dimensions of space","that they haven't ever seen?"],"1011":["Right."],"1012":["Mm-hmm."],"1013":["It does.","In fact, one way that different universes","might be created and be different from each other","is that different universes could have","effectively different numbers of dimensions.","Like we have three dimensions around us,","but there's people out there, aliens, who could live","in five dimensional universes."],"1014":["It's a, yeah."],"1015":["We think that it would be,","no all of this is incredibly speculative,","and we don't know for sure.","But the idea is that there is some deep down","underlying laws that are universal and the same,","but they show up differently,","so they appear different.","So the specific particles and forces and masses","would be completely different in different parts","of the multiverse."],"1016":["Why in the world would you think that there","are extra dimensions, right?","So you've heard of string theory?"],"1017":["Mm-hmm.","So we have quantum mechanics, right?","The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work,","and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't","seem to fit in.","It's the one force of nature that we can't really","easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework,","so string theory is one of the best ideas."],"1018":["That's the good news.","The bad news is that it only seems to work","if spacetime is ten dimensional.","[chuckles]","So you would say well then it's wrong.","It can't be right.","Spacetime is not ten-dimensional.","Spacetime is four dimensional.","We've observed that.","But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional","to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory","we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional,","maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow.","So here's how we could get lucky.","We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space","that are curled up somehow","that are so small that we can't see them.","This is actually an old idea.","It goes back to Kaluza and Klein","right after general relativity was invented in 1915.","But there's a more recent idea that says","there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions.","There could be extra dimensions that are actually","that big, like a millimeter across","that you would not have noticed.","But here's the new, exciting idea.","So let's imagine, okay.","This is a piece of paper.","But let's imagine this is our entire world.","So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional,","but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down","to two dimensions, so we all live here.","You and I live here.","But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space.","So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay?","And let's imagine that.","When I say we live on this three dimensional world","what I mean is imagine that the particles","that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons,","the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about,","electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force,","the strong nuclear force,","imagine they can't leave this surface.","This is what we call a brane.","B-R-A-N-E.","Have you heard this word before?"],"1019":["[Sean] Do you know where it comes from?"],"1020":["From membranes, you know.","We have lines, one dimension.","We have two dimensional surfaces.","So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing,","you call it a string, right?"],"1021":["If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates","and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane.","Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular","as string theory, but it's been around for a while.","But if you had extra dimensions of space,","then you can three dimensional vibrating things,","and four dimensional vibrating things."],"1022":["Well basically the strings are the particles that we see.","It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw,","if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional.","A little loop of string,","so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating.","If you look at it from very, very far away,","it just looks like a particle.","So in string theory, an electron is a little string.","A photon is a little string."],"1023":["Yes, string theory's even better.","So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s","for theories that joined electricity and magnetism.","So a good string theory is gravity plus","the Grand Unified Theory."],"1024":["It's even better.","It's the theory of everything.","What would you tell a friend of yours","if they asked you what dimensions are,","what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?"],"1025":["That's right.","And we could live there.","The world we see around us, the three dimensions","of space around us could reflect the fact","that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane","trying to escape."],"1026":["You're a string theorist, so tell us what kind","of string theory you do, what it means","to be a string theorist."],"1027":["Cool, so do you think a lot about extra dimensions","in your everyday life?"],"1028":["And so when you think about extra dimensions,","you put them together with brains and different fields","wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth, right?"],"1029":["You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists,","they care a lot about all the different ways","in which we could hide the extra dimensions.","As someone who cares about cosmology,","I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions","small at all?","How did that happen?","Is this something you think about yourself?"],"1030":["The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote","with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall","where we realize there's another way","to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically.","If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper","you couldn't wrap up everything,","but within some region of space you could make a tube."],"1031":["Right?","And down there in the tube it looks like","your long thing that is compactified in one direction","and infinitely extending in the other direction,","so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space."],"1032":["[Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?"],"1033":["Yeah.","So we certainly assume that they're all large","as a starting point, and it's worse than that.","So in our paper we imagine you start","in de Sitter space.","You start in a universe with no matter,","no anything like that, just empty space","but with an energy that is positive","and all the dimensions are large."],"1034":["It was always there."],"1035":["Why not?"],"1036":["Well you know, I think that this is again, this is--"],"1037":["I would say that we shouldn't be prejudiced","one way or the other."],"1038":["Yeah, so let me tell you a little bit more","about the scenario.","So you know there are black holes, good?","Right?"],"1039":["[Sean] There are black branes as well."],"1040":["Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?"],"1041":["Yeah, I've been trying to explain this","to lower levels, and they always look at me like,","are you pulling my leg here a little bit?","Or is this the real thing that they use?","Yes, it is the real thing they use.","We study these branes in de Sitter space,","and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions","which instead of having a singularity inside","are non-singular, and stable, and compactified.","Is this a familiar thing?","I know things like this have been discussed, right?"],"1042":["Right.","Imagine that rather than going down to a point,","it just asymptotes to some fixed radius","that continues infinitely far down there.","But then you can ask, okay what about the rest","of the universe?","You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified,","and the balance between the cosmological constant","and the electromagnetic field keeps it","at a fixed distance."],"1043":["But then the other dimensions,","the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter.","They can have either positive, zero,","or negative cosmological constant.","So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution","times a compactified sphere."],"1044":["I guess.","I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise.","Again or maybe you could change my mind,","I think that as long as it can happen","it will happen some of the time, right?"],"1045":["I mean it's one of the things that could happen, so","I mean it obviously,","You know, we know--"],"1046":["It's quantum.","[laughing]","It's a loud, it's of a loud","it's gonna happen."],"1047":["Someone probably wrote it for him.","So it's possible that if you do have this starting point","of an empty de Sitter space","with positive cosmological constants and fields lying around","you inevitably get a multiverse.","It just happens, you know,","it's just part of quantum nucleation to different things,","and then maybe you need to explain","why we live in this universe","rather than some other one","via the anthropic principle or something like that.","So how does our kind of, you know, low-tech","old fashioned way of making new universes intersect","with the kinds of things you'd think about."],"1048":["They overlap, they wrap around."],"1049":["I know not everyone buys that, right?"],"1050":["And if we put aside for the second","the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics,","and it's just amongst us chickens,","what do you think about the future of cosmology","and string theory, and the dynamics","of these extra dimensions?"],"1051":["If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime","can emerge from quantum mechanics,","they could read the graphic novel you just wrote."],"1052":["And I just wrote a book","called Something Deeply Hidden","about many worlds, quantum mechanics,","and how spacetime can emerge from it.","Plenty of reading material for the audience out there."],"1053":["So that was fun.","I hope that everyone did learn something.","I know that I did.","It was very nice to see how the idea of dimensions","and space resonates in different ways","with different people, all the way up to talking","to Clifford about the forefront of modern research.","I really do think that we're not done","understanding how dimensions work.","There are three dimensions of space, why that?","Why not two?","Why not 27?","I think that we really don't yet have the data","or ideas to think about this, but we're creeping up on it.","I'm optimistic about progress in the near future."],"1054":["Yes, a lot."],"1055":["Yeah, kind of."],"1056":["Um, I'm not so sure."],"1057":["At the camp","I made a 3D printing one."],"1058":["So I don't choose the size,","all I had to do was the shape."],"1059":["It's three dimensional."],"1060":["So, ordinary printing would be 2D."],"1061":["Hmm, I think one dimensional might be a circle, I guess,","or maybe a line."],"1062":["Yeah, a line."],"1063":["[Hank] Yeah."],"1064":["That's one dimensional."],"1065":["So everything has to be one or two dimensional","before it's three dimensional."],"1066":["I think I would be maybe there,","since I'm facing it."],"1067":["Yeah."],"1068":["Has its own unit."],"1069":["Yeah."],"1070":["Unlike three dimensional, you have to tell a lot","'cause if it's like a sphere, you kind of have","to start using points."],"1071":["If you make it","two dimensional is this, a corner."],"1072":["Another way is if you have space in between","is an angle."],"1073":["Yeah."],"1074":["I think that would be an X or a Y axis, so--"],"1075":["3D is the maximum of dimensions for shapes."],"1076":["Yeah."],"1077":["So at least everything has a certain dimension."],"1078":["That would be an amazing discovery.","The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly."],"1079":["Yeah."],"1080":["Yeah, I do."],"1081":["I like biology and computer science."],"1082":["I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it,","but I know, like the first four."],"1083":["[laughing] Yeah."],"1084":["Um ..."],"1085":["Um ..."],"1086":["Okay."],"1087":["Mm-hmm."],"1088":["Yeah, I was actually doing SAT prep."],"1089":["It showed like the X Y and Z axis as well."],"1090":["No."],"1091":["Yeah."],"1092":["Time?"],"1093":["I have no idea."],"1094":["Oh."],"1095":["[Juliana] Yeah."],"1096":["[Juliana] Yeah."],"1097":["So, there's like how many dimension would there be?"],"1098":["Yeah."],"1099":["Oh, okay.","So since it's all theoretical,","like this could not be three dimensional."],"1100":["Oh. [laughs]"],"1101":["Oh. [laughs]"],"1102":["Yeah."],"1103":["[Juliana] Yeah."],"1104":["Oh, man.","I mean, I guess what I've learned today","is just that there are not just three dimensions","or at least we think, I mean everything's theoretical.","It's all just really kind of confusing."],"1105":["Oh yeah."],"1106":["Yeah."],"1107":["I'm gonna be a sophomore at Pomona College,","and I study math and physics."],"1108":["I really don't know.","I like theory and experimental so it's kind of tough","for me to say."],"1109":["Yeah."],"1110":["Hopefully, yeah."],"1111":["My first intuitive thought is what are the coordinates."],"1112":["So if we are looking at things,","if we're looking at like a dot,","or a line rather, that's one dimensional","because we can only measure it one way,","but then if we look at like a square","then we're increasing like that,","so it's basically what coordinates we can use","to measure something."],"1113":["Yeah."],"1114":["Mm-hmm."],"1115":["Okay."],"1116":["Why though?"],"1117":["Okay."],"1118":["Yeah."],"1119":["Yeah."],"1120":["So it's kind of like our fundamental time?","Or our base time?"],"1121":["I see."],"1122":["Why is that, that this one's shorter then?"],"1123":["I see.","Oh, okay."],"1124":["All right."],"1125":["Would it be if I had like a spring","or not a spring, but like a sheet,","and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?"],"1126":["I see."],"1127":["I see."],"1128":["I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox.","Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me","on the train, they think they're stationary on the train.","Like they think that they're not accelerating,","but if they start walking through the train cars,","then they are accelerating in their frame,","but then from my outside frame","where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating.","So I guess that relativity is all about perspective,","I guess in a way."],"1129":["That was pretty good."],"1130":["So, I work on two ground-based surveys in the optical,","and we're basically trying to make huge maps","of the universe so that we can study dark energy."],"1131":["I've heard it, yeah."],"1132":["I get a little scared,","[laughing]","because I think how can you prove these theories?"],"1133":["One theory I've heard of, I don't know if this fits in","with that, is bubble universes."],"1134":["Is that an extra dimension?","Does that fit into that, or is that something?"],"1135":["And are each of those dimensions,","are they governed by the same laws of physics,","or is there like a separate Lagrangian for each universe--"],"1136":["[Bela] Or how does that work?"],"1137":["Okay."],"1138":["I have.","So string theory is basically a theory","of quantum gravity."],"1139":["Right."],"1140":["I've heard it, yeah."],"1141":["No."],"1142":["Right."],"1143":["So how do these strings give rise to things","like mass and charge, and basically give us","the properties of the particles that we see?"],"1144":["So, is string theory part of what they call","the Grand Unified Theory?","Is it supposed to be the last thing","that sort of unifies all the forces together?"],"1145":["Okay."],"1146":["So we have three spatial dimensions.","A brane is sort of the next level.","So a brane is a higher dimensional object","that vibrates through space."],"1147":["It was really cool to learn about strings and branes","and how looking at gravity on small scales","is actually connected to what I do","in looking at gravity on these cosmological scales,","and it's definitely something I'm gonna think about","in my research."],"1148":["One of the things that's key","in the whole story of string theory","is the piece of it that talks about","quantum theories of gravity.","So I'm very excited about what happens to spacetime,","what does it even mean at the quantum level."],"1149":["Uh, yes I do."],"1150":["Yes."],"1151":["Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand","the observable universe.","If string theory turns out to be the thing","that the universe cares about,","we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities","that are in string theory, how do we get the one","that looks like the world we live in?"],"1152":["Okay."],"1153":["Hmm. Okay, that's nice."],"1154":["It sounds like fun.","What I would immediately ask is","where do the large dimensions come from in the first place?","Is that something you address, or you just assume","that all the dimension are large as a starting point?"],"1155":["But where do they come from?"],"1156":["Why?"],"1157":["Okay.","[laughing]"],"1158":["You're replacing one prejudice with a different prejudice."],"1159":["Just a large, ten or 11 dimensions","with a cosmological constant","doesn't seem like a fundamental starting point.","It sounds like there needs to be something","to underlie that.","But it's a fun scenario."],"1160":["I've heard of them."],"1161":["Indeed."],"1162":["Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole","in that you have far away from it","you have these large just flat dimensions.","As you move in, there's something in the interior.","It has, itself, higher dimensions,","and so because physicists love to joke","they thought, well it's like a membrane","but it can have many different dimensions.","Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions,","and so they called them P-branes."],"1163":["Yeah. Yeah.","So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying","things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes","in various dimensions actually start out","as these non-singular type brains,","and then you find in the core,","there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime."],"1164":["Right. Good, good."],"1165":["Is it that these have the lowest action","of all the things that could possibly,","all the possible solutions?"],"1166":["Okay, that's fair."],"1167":["It's quantum, baby."],"1168":["I still laugh from Keanu Reeves I'm afraid.","[laughing]"],"1169":["Well, it's interesting because there's a lot","of activity going on inspired by things we learned","from working in anti-de Sitter space","where the cosmological constant has the wrong sign.","So you will find that there are a number of papers","as many of which you've probably read,","probably you've read more of them than I have,","which try then to take the different kinds of brains,","these extended solutions, and they're many different kinds","doing different things, we understand well enough now","that we can put them together in various ways.","They intersect, they dissolve inside each other,","they wrap each other."],"1170":["They overlap, and you do them in all sorts","of different ways and show that you can construct","four dimensional universes with a cosmological constant","of your desire, depending upon how you did the construction."],"1171":["Not everyone buys it.","There's a big discussion in the literature right now."],"1172":["I think it's gonna get way more interesting","than we're currently able to grapple with right now,","and I think there are hints of it.","There could be a description of the physics","that might be our early universe","that is like that molecular description.","And then from that emerges flat spacetimes","maybe four, maybe some mechanism tells you","it's four and not something else.","I think that's where we're going."],"1173":["Right, yes.","I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues:","Conversations About the Nature of Universe."],"1174":["Excellent."],"1175":["Hi, I'm Hilary Mason. I'm a computer scientist.","And today, I've been asked to explain machine learning","in five levels of increasing complexity.","Machine learning gives us the ability to learn things","about the world from large amounts of data","that we as human beings can't possibly study or appreciate.","So machine learning is when we teach computers","to learn patterns from looking at examples in data,","such that they can recognize those patterns","and apply them to new things that they haven't seen before."],"1176":["Hi."],"1177":["I'm Hilary, what's your name?"],"1178":["Do you know what machine learning means?","Have you heard that before?"],"1179":["So machine learning is a way that we teach computers","to learn things about the world by looking at patterns","and looking at examples of things.","So can I show you an example","of how a machine might learn something?"],"1180":["[Hilary] So is this a dog or a cat?"],"1181":["And this one?"],"1182":["And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?"],"1183":["That's true.","Do you think, if we look at these pictures,","do you think maybe we could say,","Well, they both have pointy ears,","but the dogs have a different kind of body","and the cats like to stand up a little different.?","Do you think that makes sense?"],"1184":["What about this one?"],"1185":["This one's a jackal. And it's actually a kind of dog.","But you made a good guess.","That's what machines do too. They make guesses.","Is this a cat or a dog?"],"1186":["[Hilary] None. What is it?"],"1187":["And how did you know that it's not a cat or a dog?"],"1188":["And so, you did something pretty amazing there.","Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog?","And you said, I disagree with your question. It's a human.","So machine learning is when we teach machines","to make guesses about what things are","based on looking at a lot of different examples.","And I build products that use machine learning","to learn about the world and make guesses","about things in the world.","When we try to teach machines to recognize things","like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples.","We have to show them tens of thousands","or even millions of examples","before they can get even close to as good at it as you are.","Do you have tests in school?"],"1189":["Are those like the practice problems","you do before the test?"],"1190":["Which means that in the test,","you're not seeing any problems","that you don't know how to solve.","As long as you did all your practice, right?"],"1191":["So machines work the same way.","If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice,","they'll learn how to guess.","And then when you give them the test,","they should be able to do that.","So we looked at eight pictures","and you were able to answer really quickly.","But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples?","Would you be able to do that so quickly?"],"1192":["So one of the differences between people and machines","is that people might be a little better at this,","but can't look at 10 million different things.","So now that we've been talking about machine learning,","is this something you want to learn how to do?"],"1193":["And machine learning is a great way to use","all those math skills, all those coding skills,","and would be a super cool tool for a spy."],"1194":["Hi. Are you a student, Lucy?"],"1195":["Congratulations."],"1196":["Have you ever heard of machine learning before?"],"1197":["That's right.","When we teach machines to learn from data,","to build a model from that data or a representation of that,","and then to make a prediction.","One of the places we often find machine learning","in the real world is in things like recommendation systems.","So do you have an artist that you really like?"],"1198":["So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez.","And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez,","one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra.","Do you know who that is?"],"1199":["So let's listen to a hint of this song."],"1200":["All right.","So why do you think Spotify might've recommended that song?"],"1201":["And that's actually a really interesting thing","to think about because that creepy vibe","is something that you can perceive and I can perceive,","but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine.","What do you think might go into that?"],"1202":["It's a great question.","The machine can understand","whatever we tell it to understand.","So there might be a person thinking about things,","like the pitch or the pacing or the tone,","or sometimes machines can figure out","things about music or images or videos","that we don't tell it to discover,","but that it can learn","from looking at a lot of different examples.","Why do you think companies might use machine learning?"],"1203":["Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny.","And I think that's because they're based on so much data.","They know where you live. They know where your device is.","It's also important to realize that people in aggregate","are actually pretty predictable.","Like when we talk to each other,","we like to talk about the novel things,","like here, we're having this conversation.","We don't do this every day.","But we probably still eat breakfast.","We're gonna eat lunch. We're gonna eat dinner.","You probably are going to the same home","you go to most of the time.","And so, they're able to take that data","that we already give them and make predictions based on that","as to what ads they should show us."],"1204":["[Hilary laughs]"],"1205":["That's right.","To do machine learning, we use something called algorithms.","Have you heard of algorithms before?"],"1206":["That's right."],"1207":["So there are things that machines are really great at","that humans are actually not great at.","And imagine watching every video posted to TikTok every day.","So we just don't have enough time to do that","at the rate at which we can actually watch those videos.","But a machine can analyze all of them","and then make recommendations to us.","And then thinking about things that machines are bad at","and people are good at, people are really great","with only one or two examples of learning something new","and incorporating that into our model of the world","to make good decisions.","Whereas machines often need tens of thousands of examples,","and that's not even getting into things like good judgment","because we care about people,","because we can imagine a future that we want to live in","that doesn't exist today.","And that's something that is still uniquely human.","Machines are great at predicting","based on what they've seen in the past,","but they're not creative.","They're not going to invent.","They're not gonna, you know,","really change where we're gonna go.","That's up to us."],"1208":["[Hilary] And what are you majoring in?"],"1209":["So in your studies,","have you learned about machine learning?"],"1210":["Absolutely.","And that's a great example because you have models","that are operating to do things like figure out","if a new email is spam or not.","So what would you think","about if you were looking at an email","and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?"],"1211":["So these are things we would call features.","And we go through a process where we do feature engineering,","where somebody looks at the example and says,","Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us","to statistically tell the difference","from something in one category versus another.","So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian,","you start getting a lot of email in Russian."],"1212":["This is a great question","because it really gets to the difference","between some of our different tools","in our machine learning tool belt","in addressing problems like this.","So if we were to use a supervised learning classic","classification approach,","a person would need to think about those features","and creatively come up with them","in approach we call the kitchen sink approach,","which is just try everything you can possibly think of","and see what works.","Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data","and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data","is you're projecting that data into a space","and looking for things like clusters.","And there's a bunch of really fun math","about how you do that, how you think about distance","and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points","in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?"],"1213":["Supervised learning, we have our labels","and we're trying to figure out what statistically indicates","if something matches one label or another label.","Unsupervised learning,","we don't necessarily have those labels.","That's the thing we're trying to discover.","So reinforcement learning is another technique","that we use sometimes.","You can think about it like a turn in a game","and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials","so that you're able to develop a system","that by experimenting with reinforcement learning","can eventually learn to play these games","pretty successfully.","Deep learning, which is essentially using neural networks","and very large amounts of data to eventually iterate","on a network structure that can make predictions."],"1214":["It is, but it also thrives in environments","where you have a decision point,","a pallet of actions to choose from.","And it actually comes historically","from trying to train a robot to navigate a room.","If it bonks into this chair, it can't go forward anymore.","And if it falls into that pit,","you know, it's not going to succeed.","But if it keeps exploring, it'll eventually get to the goal."],"1215":["[Hilary] Yes.","[both laugh]"],"1216":["So typically, you would choose deep learning","if you have sufficient high quality data,","hopefully labeled in a useful way.","If you really are happy not to necessarily understand","or be able to interpret what your system is doing","or you're willing to invest","in another set of work afterwards to understand","what the system is doing once you've already trained it.","And this also comes down to the fact that some things","are actually really easy to solve with linear regression","or simple statistical approaches.","And some things are impossible."],"1217":["You build a system that could actually be useless.","So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company","and they had a data scientist","who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn.","It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful","because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was.","So they could say, you know,","Sunny, you're likely to quit next month.","But they had no idea what to do about it.","And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes."],"1218":["Yeah.","This is actually a good example of a very real world","kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this","was to build an interpretable system","on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away,","but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why."],"1219":["It's actually fairly new","that we're able to solve all of these problems","and start to build these products and apply it in businesses","and apply it, you know, everywhere.","And so, we're still developing good practices","and what it means to be a professional in machine learning.","We're really developing a notion of what good looks like."],"1220":["So would you mind telling me a bit about","what you've been working on or interested in lately?"],"1221":["So what are some of the techniques you're applying","to look at that debate data?"],"1222":["Do you think there are going to be general principles","that guide those decisions?","Because right now, it's generally","up to the machine learning engineer to decide","what tools they want to apply."],"1223":["So is that where some of that frustration","around the lack of controllability","and interpretability comes from?"],"1224":["If you train a model off of language off the internet,","it sometimes says uncomfortable things","or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things.","Have you ever run into this yourself?","And then how do you think about that problem","of potentially even measuring the bias","in a model that we've trained?"],"1225":["I imagine in the last few years,","we've seen a lot of changes and improvements","in the capabilities of NLP systems.","So is there anything in that","that you're particularly excited about exploring further?"],"1226":["Yeah, I agree."],"1227":["So, hi Claudia. It's so great to see you."],"1228":["You know, we first met 10, 11 years ago","and machine learning has changed a lot since then."],"1229":["Well, you're absolutely right that the attention","machine learning gets has grown dramatically.","20 years ago, going to gatherings","and telling people what I was working on","and seeing the blank face or the like,","Where's the turn? and walk away.","Like, Oh, no.","The accessibility of the tooling,","like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code","something that would have taken 500 lines","of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code","even, you know, five years ago.","And that's not an exaggeration.","And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone","can pick this up and start playing with it","and start to build with it.","And that is also really exciting."],"1230":["And part of the challenge of it","is not the mathematics of building models,","but the challenge is making sure that the data","is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality."],"1231":["Right.","And so, to say that another way,","when you're collecting data from the real world","and then building machine learning systems","that automate decisions based on that data,","all of the biases and problems","that are already in the real world then can be magnified","through that machine learning system.","And so, it can make many of these problems much worse."],"1232":["And so, it's not just the provenance of that data,","but it's, sort of, deeply understanding,","Why does it look the way it looks?","Why was it collected this way?","What are the limitations of it?","We need to think about that","in entire process, how we document that process.","This is an issue in companies","where somebody might create something","that even their peers can't recreate."],"1233":["These are great questions.","So things like actuarial science, operations research,","where they actually are not using machine learning","as much as you might think.","And then you have other sorts of companies","or on the FinTech side, or even the ad tech side of things","where they perhaps are using machine learning","to the point of even absurdity."],"1234":["So when we think about the next five to 10 years,","the things that are really still holding us back","are these uneven applications of resources to problems","because the problems that get attention","are the high value ones","in terms of how much money you can make","or the things that are fashionable enough","that you can publish a paper on it.","So what do you think is holding us back?"],"1235":["I am incredibly optimistic and not...","Perhaps it's a personality flaw, but I can't help but look","at the potential of the technology to reduce harm,","to give us information that help us make better decisions.","And to think that we would choose","to address the big problems ahead of us.","I don't think we have a hope of addressing them","without figuring out the role","that machine learning will play.","And to think that we would then choose not to do that","is just unthinkable."],"1236":["I hope you learned something about machine learning.","There has never been a better time to study machine learning","because you're now able to build products","that have tremendous potential and impact"],"1237":["Hi."],"1238":["I'm Brynn."],"1239":["No."],"1240":["Sure."],"1241":["It's a dog."],"1242":["A cat."],"1243":["Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats.","Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think."],"1244":["Yeah.

not."],"1260":["Okay."],"1261":["Well, I know that in Melanie Martinez's music,","she used a lot of the filtered voice","to make it sound very deep and low","and that song had that."],"1262":["Pitch of the music.","If it's really low or if it's super high,","it could know that.","What can the machine understand?"],"1263":["Well, I think things like Facebook or Instagram,","they probably use it to

I've already given them.","And it almost seems like","they're watching us."],"1266":["A set of steps or a process","carried out to complete something?"],"1267":["So do you think that we've been

traditional techniques","that we have, things like lexicons","or some sort of template matching techniques","for extracting features from texts.","That's a question I'm just interested in, in general.","When do we really need deep learning","versus when can we use something","that's a little bit more interpretable,","something that's been around for a while?"],"1283":["I definitely think there is,","but I also, sort of, see it varying a lot","based on the use case,","something that, kind of, works out of the box","and maybe works a little bit more automatically","might be better.","And in other cases, you do, sort of, kind of,","you want a lot of fine grain control."],"1284":["Yeah, if you're building a model","that just predicts the next thing","based off of everything it's seen from texts online,","then yeah, you're really gonna be replicating","whatever that distribution online is."],"1285":["Yeah, it's a really tricky question.","As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict","the next sequence of words,","given a certain sequence of words.","So we could start with just, sort of, prompts","like the woman was versus the man was,","and, kind of, pull out common words","that are, sort of, more used","with one phrase versus the other.","So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it.","It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model","is gonna behave in one particular instance.","And I think that's what's really tricky","and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good","for creators of systems to just be honest","about, This is, sort of, what we have seen.","And so then, someone can make their own judgment about,","Is this gonna be too high risk","for, sort of, my particular use case?"],"1286":["I'm really interested in, sort of, the creative potential","that we've started to see from NLP systems","with things like GPT-3","and other really powerful language models.","It's really easy to write long grammatical passages","thinking about the way that we can then harness, like,","the human ability to actually give meaning to those words","and, sort of, provide

that we now have, the capacity,","and also, an elevation of the problem sets","that we're dealing with and how to frame the problem.","And I'm almost struggling to figure out","whether it's a blessing

that?"],"1289":["In contrast, what I'm struggling with,","the friend of mine who asked me","to look at some health care data for him.","And despite the capabilities that we're having","in all of the, kind of, bigger societal problems","alongside with data collection engineering,","all the gnarly stuff,","that is actually not the machine learning itself,","it's the rest of it where certain data isn't available.","And to me, it's staggering how difficult it is","to get it off the ground and actually use."],"1290":["And how transparent do I need to build it","for it to be adopted at some point?","What types of biases in the data collection,","and then also in the usage?","We now call it the bias, but we're still struggling","with the society not really living up to its expectations","and then machine learning, bringing it to the forefront."],"1291":["Feeling increasingly challenged","that my skillset of being very good at programming","has become somewhat

point?","What types of biases in the data collection","and then also in the usage?","I think, in certain areas, we have societal expectations","as to what is fair and what isn't."],"1292":["What have you seen in terms of which industries,","where they stand, like who is adopting now?","Who is ready to utilize it?","Where would you maybe wish that didn't even try?","[Hilary laughs]"],"1293":["So I spent about eight years working in ad tech.","And the motivation was really","because it was such an amazingly exciting playground","to push that technology","that used to largely live in academia, really,","out in the world and see, kind of, what it can achieve.","It has created such a hunger for data","that now everything is being collected.","I'm curious, when are we going to","make a foray into things like agriculture","about smart production of the things we eat?","You see and hear these interesting stories,","but I feel like we're not ready yet","to put that into a economically viable situation."],"1294":["I fully agree on the steps you pointed out","and the processes.","I think there is a chicken and egg problem,","like your former example,","that these areas that need to wait for

unfortunately, I feel a drifting apart","between academia","and the uses of AI,","but I am somewhat frustrated with a generation of students","who have standard data sets that they never think

world where a lot more of that","is used for the right purposes."],"1296":["Hi, I'm Robert J. Lang.","I'm a physicist and origami artist","and today I've been challenged to explain origami","in five levels.","If you know a little origami","you might think it's nothing more than simple toys,","like cranes or cootie catchers,","but origami is much more than that.","Out of the vast cloud of origami possibilities","I've chosen five different levels","that illustrate the diversity of this art."],"1297":["Do you know what origami is?"],"1298":["Yes, in fact it is.","Have you ever done any origami before?"],"1299":["[Robert] Would you like to give it a try?"],"1300":["Okay, so we'll do some,","but I want to tell you a little bit about origami.","Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs,","almost like rules.","It's usually from a square","and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts.","So these guys are folded from an uncut square."],"1301":["So you ready?"],"1302":["Okay.","We're going to start with a model","that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten,","it's called a crane, traditional origami design,","it's over 400 years old.","So, people have been doing what we're about to do","for 400 years."],"1303":["Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it","and then we'll fold it in half the other direction,","also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up","and we're going to hold the fold with both hands.","We're going to bring these corners together,","making a little pocket and then,","this is the trickiest part of this whole design,","so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer","and we're going to try to make that layer","fold right along the edge.","Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in","as you're doing that?"],"1304":["It's called a petal fold,","it's a part of a lot of origami designs","and it's key to the crane.","Now we're ready for the magic.","We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger,","reach inside,","grab the skinny point that's between the two layers,","which are the wings,","and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle.","We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side","and you have made your first origami crane."],"1305":["Now, this is a traditional Japanese design","but there are origami designs that have been around so long","we're not entirely sure where they originated.","We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher."],"1306":["So we'll start with the white side up","and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner,","in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners","to the crossing point in the center.","We'll fold it in half like a book.","On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners","and I'm going to fold it up through all layers.","There's a pocket in the middle.","We're going to spread the pocket","and bring all four corners together.","Where you have original corners of the square,","we're gonna just pop those out.","This is one of the most satisfying moments,","I think-"],"1307":["because it suddenly changes shape."],"1308":["Yeah,","but there's something else we can do with this model.","If we set it down and push on the middle","then pop it inside out","so that three flaps come up and one stays down","and then it's called talking crow","because here's a little crow's beak and mouth."],"1309":["There's thousands of other origami designs","but these are some of the first people learn","and this was, in fact,","one of the first origami designs I learned","some 50 years ago."],"1310":["So, what do you think of that?","What do you think of origami?"],"1311":["Thanks for coming."],"1312":["A lot of origami is animals, birds and things.","There's also a branch of origami that is,","it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations.","Tessellations, like most origami,","are folded from a single sheet of paper","but they make patterns,","whether it's woven patterns like that,","or woven patterns like this.","If you hold them up to the light","you can see patterns."],"1313":["The thing that makes them cool","is they're sort of like tilings,","it looks like you could put this together","by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together,","but they're still one sheet."],"1314":["There's no cuts in these just folding.","We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds,","learn how to fold little pieces and put them together","in the same way that a tiling like this","looks like it's built up of little pieces.","Can you make a fold that starts at the dot","that doesn't run all the way across the paper?"],"1315":["Mm-hmm.","Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain","and we call these mountain folds","but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way","and we call it a valley fold.","In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys."],"1316":["So they're all reversible and it turns out","that in every origami shape that folds flat,","it's going to be either three mountains and a valley","or, if we're looking at the backside,","three valleys and a mountain,","they always differ by two."],"1317":["That's a rule of all flat origami","no matter how many folds come together at a point","and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations,","it's called a twist","because that center square, as I unfold it,","it twists, it rotates."],"1318":["If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper","I could make these folds connect with that,","and these folds connect with that.","And if I had another one up here, I could make all three.","And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up","I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these,","because these are just very large twists.","In this case it's an octagon rather than a square,","but they're arranged in rows and columns.","And let's just try going along.","All right, there is our tessellation","with squares and hexagons.","So you have now designed and folded","your first origami tessellation","and perhaps you can see how just using this idea","of building up tiles and small building blocks","you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want."],"1319":["Yeah,","so what do you think now of origami and tessellations?"],"1320":["That is a great definition."],"1321":["So here's a dragon fly and he's got six legs, four wings."],"1322":["Here's a spider","with eight legs, ants with legs","and these, just like the crane,","are folded from a single uncut square."],"1323":["To figure out how to do that","we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point.","So, let's come back to the crane.","You can probably tell","that the corners of the square ended up as points,","right?"],"1324":["That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points.","How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?"],"1325":["Yeah, exactly.","Actually you've discovered something pretty neat","because you made your point not from a corner","so you've already discovered one of the key insights.","Any flap, any point, leg of the ant,","takes up a circular region of paper.","Here's our boundary.","To make your point from an edge you use that much paper","and the shape, it's almost a circle.","If we take the crane","we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern.","Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing,","and here's the other wing."],"1326":["The crane has four circles","but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise","because what about this?","There's a fifth circle, which is like that,","but does the crane have a fifth flap in it?","Let's refold it and put the wings up.","Well, yes, there is, there's another point","and that point is the fifth circle of our crane."],"1327":["And to do that","we use a new technique called circle packing","in which all of the long features of the design","are represented by circles.","So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle","and things that can be big and thick,","like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle.","Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern,","we just count the number of legs we want.","We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs,","it's also got an abdomen, that's another point,","and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points.","If we find an arrangement of 10 circles","we should be able to fold that into the spider.","So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books","and has some patterns, and this is one of them","for a flying ladybug and, in fact,","it is exactly this flying ladybug.","We've got the crease pattern here in the circles","and you might now be able to see","which circles end up as which parts,","knowing that the largest features like the wings","are going to be the largest circles,","smaller points will be smaller circles.","So any thoughts which might be?"],"1328":["Yeah, that's right."],"1329":["Mm-hmm, exactly.","And then the wings?"],"1330":["You've got it, so you are ready to design origami."],"1331":["Origami artists all around the world","now use ideas like this to design, not just insects,","but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things","that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic","but most importantly, beautiful."],"1332":["That's so cool."],"1333":["Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft","that is shaped somewhat like paper,","meaning it's big and flat,","we can use folding mechanisms from origami","to make it smaller."],"1334":["Telescopes, solar arrays,","they need to be packed into a rocket, go up,","but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way","when they get up into space."],"1335":["These are the building blocks","of many, many origami deployable shapes,","it's called a degree-4 vertex.","It's the number of lines.","So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain,","we use dash lines for valley.","We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate","some important properties of origami mechanisms.","It's important in the study of mechanisms","to take into account the rigidity.","So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity","is to take these rectangles","and we're going to fold them over and over","so that they just become stiff and rigid."],"1336":["So this is what's called","a single degree of freedom mechanism.","You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold,","and then if these are perfectly rigid","every other fold angle is fully determined.","One of the key behaviors here","is that with the smaller angles up here,","the two folds that are the same parity","and the folds that are of opposite parity","move at about the same rate","but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees,","we find they move at very different rates","and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens.","This one is almost folded","but this one goes through a much larger motion so","the relative speeds differ."],"1337":["So when we start sticking together vertices like this,","if they're individually single degree of freedom","then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close","but with just one degree of freedom.","So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori.","When you stretch them out","they're pretty big."],"1338":["And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this","was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission","that flew in 1995."],"1339":["Yeah, so typically the mechanism","will run from corner to corner,","to diagonally to opposite corners","because then you can stretch it out that way.","Notice some differences between the one you have","and the one I have","in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly","but this one opens out more one way and then the other."],"1340":["Infinitesimally small."],"1341":["So, sadly,","the only way to get them at exactly the same rate","is when these are microscopic slivers","and then that's not useful."],"1342":["And it's exactly the difference","between the motions of these two vertices.","So these angles are closer to right angles","and the closer you get to a right angle","the more asymmetry there is","between the two directions of motion.","And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack,","so these started at about the same size","but when they're flat","notice that yours is much more compact.","So if I were you making a solar array,","I'd say, oh, I want that one.","But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate,","then I want this one."],"1343":["There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work.","And there's another place","that shows up in deployable structures","in a very cool structure.","This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this","but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly,","it changes color.","There's a Mars Rover application","where they need a sleeve that protects a drill","and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse","and they're using a pattern very much like this."],"1344":["There are many open mathematical questions","and so room for mathematicians, like yourself,","to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms.","And even though those studies","are mathematically interesting,","they're going to also have real-world applications in space,","solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more.","Any questions or thoughts about this?"],"1345":["The first thing I want to show you","is origami in the real world.","This is the origami lamp.","It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together.","The lamp has LEDs on the inside","so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade","and we get the base."],"1346":["Origami applications have in common,","is that at some stage the thing is flat","and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state","and then take it to a 3D state,","or conversely, for deployables like space,","you want to have it in a fully folded flat state","but then take it to a 3D state,","or possibly an unfolded flat state.","Whenever a flat state is involved,","origami is a really effective way","of making the transition between those states."],"1347":["This is another real-world application","but this particular implementation","is used to make a wheel for a Rover."],"1348":["New problems arise","when we try to make origami out of things other than paper,","but also new opportunities.","An example here","which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori.","It's got a three-dimensional structure.","If I stretch it one way, it expands the other","but because it has these S-bends in the pattern,","if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat.","This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber","and so if I put this fold pattern into it","and then compress it","and then put a skin on the top and bottom,","this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong."],"1349":["Another origami challenge","that comes up with these patterns","is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing","we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami.","We're not going to do it by hand","and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering,","which is the design of machines","that can fold patterns that have applications."],"1350":["Yeah, so what goes in as sheet","and what comes out is this, or something this wide."],"1351":["It's something we've talked about a little bit","that with all the richness of behavior","of origami from a flat sheet,","it seems like there ought to be an equally rich world","of things that don't start flat","but are still made from flat sheets of paper."],"1352":["Bi-stable properties","and you can combine them together with copies of themselves","to make cellular structures.","They're astonishingly stiff and rigid, useful for mechanics."],"1353":["Is that where you fold paper","to make different animals, like those?"],"1354":["Nope."],"1355":["Sure."],"1356":["That's awesome."],"1357":["Yep."],"1358":["Wow."],"1359":["Yeah."],"1360":["Wow."],"1361":["Okay, good."],"1362":["Yeah."],"1363":["I have seen these before, my friends use these."],"1364":["Wow."],"1365":["Wow."],"1366":["I think that the people that make them are talented.","It's hard.","Seeing the stuff that we've made here,","I'd bet that they could do rocket ships.","Just so much that you can do with them."],"1367":["Thanks for having me."],"1368":["Wow."],"1369":["They weren't cut?"],"1370":["How about like that?"],"1371":["So all the folds are reversible?"],"1372":["Oh."],"1373":["Twists?"],"1374":["That was cool."],"1375":["Origami, I think,","is the folding of paper to make anything in general,","from 3D things to flat things","and I think origami is about turning simple things","into complex things and it's all about patterns."],"1376":["Wow."],"1377":["What?"],"1378":["Yes."],"1379":["I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane."],"1380":["Okay."],"1381":["Okay."],"1382":["Well, the legs and the antenna","would probably have to be these smaller ones,","in the middle."],"1383":["[College Student] Oh, this looks like the back","'cause there's a bunch of circles all the way down,","like here."],"1384":["You've got four big wings","which you could see on the ends there","and then, I guess, the head."],"1385":["Awesome."],"1386":["Wow, that's so impressive.","I think I learned how to make one of these paper cranes","when I was in third grade but I guess I never unfolded it","to actually see where it was coming from.","And so now that it's all broken up into circles","it makes these super complicated insects and animals","and everything seem so much simpler, so that's so cool.","I'm pretty excited about it."],"1387":["Thank you so much for telling me about this."],"1388":["Right."],"1389":["Okay."],"1390":["[Grad Student] Okay."],"1391":["Right."],"1392":["Okay."],"1393":["So then you like fly it up compactly","and then once you get up there,","there's like some sort of like motorized mechanism,","but you only need it on one fold."],"1394":["Yeah.","What sort of angle would you want","so that they open up the same rate?"],"1395":["Okay."],"1396":["For sure, right, right."],"1397":["So, it's kind of a trade-off?"],"1398":["Interesting."],"1399":["If you want to send something to space","it probably makes sense to do it compactly,","so if you have something that you can fold up","and then unfold, just one of the folds,","that's going to be probably the easiest way","to get something up there","and expand it to what it needs to be."],"1400":["I'm Tom Hull, I'm a math professor, a mathematician.","I've been doing origami since I was eight years old","and studying the mathematics of origami","ever since grad school, at least."],"1401":["Why does origami lend itself","to, say, this type of application?"],"1402":["Another aspect of origami and origami mechanisms","that has leant itself to many different uses","is the fact that it's scalable.","When you have an origami crease pattern","like the Miura-Ori used in solar panel deployment,","the type of motion that you see happening here","will happen whether this is on a piece of paper","that's small like this, or on a larger scale,","or even on a smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller scale.","Engineers, in particular robotics engineers,","are turning to origami","toward designing mechanisms that will either be really big","or really, really small.","This looks like the most promising way","of getting nano robotics to work."],"1403":["Cool, so this is something","that can actually get really, really tiny","but then get big and fat and roll."],"1404":["Yeah!"],"1405":["So you're talking about a machine","that is actually folding it into this,","not just making the creases but actually folding it."],"1406":["That's cool, yeah.","What do you see as kind of like the next big breakthrough?","Is there anything out there on the horizon","that you're just like, oh wow, this is really exciting?"],"1407":["So like a cone?"],"1408":["The thing that I think I'm the most excited about","comes from math mainly.","When I look at origami,","when I look at all these applications","or just all these different origami folds, I see structure.","Math is really about patterns.","The patterns that we see in origami","are reflecting some kind of mathematical structure","and we don't quite know yet what all of that structure is","and if we can tie a mathematical structure","that's already well-studied","to something we see happening in origami,","then we can use the math tools right away","to help solve the engineering problems","and the origami problems.","And the fact that there's so many applications to this","is really making people excited who are working in the area.","I'm really excited to see what happens with that","in the next five years or so."],"1409":["My name's Bobby Kasthuri, I'm assistant professor at","the University of Chicago, I'm a neuroscientist at","Argonne National Labs.","(soft music)","What the connectome is, is it's a kind of a newly made-up","term for describing a kind of neuroscience research where we","try to map the brain at a scale that's","never been mapped before.","Every person here can leave with understanding it","at some level."],"1410":["Do you know why we're here today?"],"1411":["Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk","about a very specific kinda science,","about people who study brains.","Do you know what a brain is?","What is it?"],"1412":["Definitely.","So what we're gonna talk about,","this is something that people study","in the brain called the connectome."],"1413":["Do you know that your body is made up of really tiny","things called cells?"],"1414":["Okay, well there's more cells in your brain,","like way more cells, than all the stars we can see.","(Daniel gasps)","(Bobby laughs)","And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know","where every cell in your brain is and how it talks","to every other cell in your brain."],"1415":["That was awesome, Daniel, thank you."],"1416":["Connectome."],"1417":["That's good, that's a great place to start.","There are cells in your brain.","Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other.","Electricity travels down those wires and communicates","from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain,","and each of those brain cells makes, you know,","a thousand connections, it's something like","a hundred trillion connections."],"1418":["In one brain, in your brain.","Could I take all of that information","and put it inside a computer?","Would that computer then be you?"],"1419":["I would say that that map also has your feelings in it","because, here's why, your feelings,","most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway,","and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry","or scared, that's just brain cells","communicating with each other."],"1420":["So, I think today we're gonna talk about a connectome.","Have you ever heard of that?"],"1421":["Yeah."],"1422":["Awesome, good.","(laughs)","It's a map of all the connections","between every neuron in your brain.","It literally, in a human brain, something like a map of","the one quadrillion connections that a","hundred billion neurons make with each other."],"1423":["Yes."],"1424":["Yeah."],"1425":["We have to use electron microscopes","and then what we have been developing a way","to slice the brain into really thin slices,","use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice,","and then use computers to put it all back.","Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right?","And we knew how neurons fire.","Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map,","and then therefore, that computer should be able to think","just like the brain that we extracted it from?"],"1426":["Neurons are also digital.","Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire,","so that's either one or zero.","And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that","actually produce the 10 thousand different","answers that you say."],"1427":["Yeah, great."],"1428":["Huh."],"1429":["This is where it gets really crazy.","Could we simulate that map inside a computer","and would that computer then be thinking","like that original brain from which we made the map?"],"1430":["Huh."],"1431":["Because there's more to you in here","than just information passing between neurons."],"1432":["Huh.","It would be like if you simulated a hurricane.","Imagine we could keep track of every variable","of a hurricane. Ever.","Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera.","Temperature.","And we put that inside a super-fast computer","and we simulated it, right?","I don't think anyone would think that","the inside of the computer would get wet.","Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly,","that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are.","Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus","a female brain to look for differences between those,","to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?"],"1433":["Wait, what do you think is sensitive?"],"1434":["Maybe a wiring diagram is not sufficient to understand","the brain, and it would be crazy to think that that would be","sufficient, actually."],"1435":["Sometimes when people get, they worry about connectomics,","I think what they're actually worrying about is that","it's the end of the that we used to do neuroscience."],"1436":["I'm not sure if you had a connectome of a human brain,","of an adult human, I would be able to read out","memories from that."],"1437":["It could absolutely be but without knowing","what the weights were before the memory was made."],"1438":["Yes."],"1439":["So and a musician, how much of it do you think","is in your hands versus in your brains?","Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles","from the nerves that are from your spinal cord,","what if some of the learning is there?"],"1440":["Yeah.","We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM","and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem,","but it's the only problem that needs to be solved","right away, is that the data analysis, right?","In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough","humans ever to map a mouse brain","where you collect every connection and et cetera","so the problem is to get algorithms to trace,","to recognize things in brains","the way humans would recognize things in brains,","or map things, trace things in brains.","It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting","the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once","and those are the kinds of ethical concerns","that I'm worried about."],"1441":["One of the things that we're not doing well as a field","is sort of educating and telling people beyond our field","the benefits of what we could achieve","but I'm impressed that when you talk to people about","something that seems kind of crazy and outlandish","and perhaps they hadn't been talking about before,","it doesn't take 'em long to come to a kind of","considered opinion, especially children.","I think it's kind of amazing.","I mean, I do hope that more people talk about brains","and what we use brains for","and the ways that we shouldn't use our brains.","So I think this field has the opportunity","to make that more real."],"1442":["Because we're talking about science."],"1443":["Um, something that helps you remember things."],"1444":["Oh."],"1445":["Um, yes, I know that."],"1446":["Oh."],"1447":["Connectone?"],"1448":["To be honest, I have no idea."],"1449":["Whoa."],"1450":["Computers they don't have feelings,","they won't have feelings and I think that's one thing that","makes the human race strong."],"1451":["A connectome?"],"1452":["No, I don't think so."],"1453":["Is this like a map where, that's like an actual visual","representation, like using microscopy?"],"1454":["Or just data?","Wow, wow."],"1455":["I'm understanding more so that it's these,","a mapping of the circuitry,","the pathways between neurons that can lead","to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common","between different people."],"1456":["Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary","so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no","questions, but a human brain has","an infinity of directions that it can go."],"1457":["It's a large scale attempt to understand the wiring map","of the brain, essentially."],"1458":["I think that it's definitely needed."],"1459":["Understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely","important but, it doesn't necessarily tell us everything","about the function, there's some sort of temporal order","from neuron to neuron and region to region","that we may not be able to pick up."],"1460":["I mean that's not the person, I mean, having a","representation of someone's neural network","is just that,","it's just a representation of the neural network."],"1461":["I mean."],"1462":["I'd like to think so."],"1463":["Every single person is different and so it should be","okay to map every single person's brain.","I mean I understand that there are,","that it's very sensitive, you know?"],"1464":["Mapping an Indian brain versus a Caucasian brain, or,","politically I think that people may have some issue with","mapping out what causes","or what makes a difference between","different types of people."],"1465":["If you limit the connectome to be just the wiring diagram","without, you know, more information about myelination","or glial cells, all types of environmental features that","surround the neurons and axons then you have an incomplete","picture, no doubt."],"1466":["What do you think about memory?","Do you think that there's ways of resolving what the","substrate of human memory is,","you know, is it just LTP and LTD?"],"1467":["You don't think it's just the synaptic weights,","like an artificial neural network that's trained","to do particular things?"],"1468":["What if you had a violinist learn a piece of Bach music,","could you find those notes somewhere in their brain","if they didn't know before?"],"1469":["I'm a musician and I don't think it's possible.","I think that there are too many, you know,","so much of it is associative to what you already know."],"1470":["Are you still doing EM or?"],"1471":["Hi, my name is Samy Kamkar.","I am a security researcher, computer hacker,","and co-founder of Openpath Security.","I've been challenged today to explain one simple concept","in five levels of increasing complexity.","My topic, hacking.","Hacking to me is using or manipulating a system in a way","that it wasn't intended or really expected.","And that could be a computer or it could be a phone","or a drone or a satellite.","It could really be anything."],"1472":["Do you know what computer hacking is?"],"1473":["Yeah, it's crazy.","They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there","who are doing just that.","They're going into people's accounts","and they're stealing money,","but there's also another side of computer hacking where","there are people who are trying to learn how","those bad hackers are actually breaking in","to the bank accounts."],"1474":["What they're trying to do is","they're trying to even prevent","the bad hackers from getting in in the first place."],"1475":["Yeah, exactly.","They're looking for ways that they can create protection.","It's kind of like the lock on your front door.","That lock is to essentially prevent","bad people from coming in","or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't.","A hacker is essentially looking at a way,","how can I get into this lock?","But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it","so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey,","we can actually protect people","by making the lock a little harder."],"1476":["In many cases, they'll send them a new lock.","So it's an upgraded, better version.","Sometimes that's new features,","but sometimes that's bug fixes","and ways to protect you as well."],"1477":["That's a very good point.","You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law.","They might work with the lock company and say,","I'm trying to improve your product.","And they're trying to find these holes or problems,","and then share that with the company.","Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing","as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset,","and you're using the same exact techniques and information","to try to break that lock,","but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone","like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected.","So hopefully they don't get in trouble","because they're the good guys."],"1478":["I started doing the good hacking","when I turned nine years old."],"1479":["I started going on the computer and playing video games,","but I had some ideas of my own,","and that's where I started to learn how to hack.","I wanted to play with my friends on this video game","and just change the way that things look."],"1480":["That's entirely possible.","They may have done it for a reason,","but you may have come up with a really good idea that,","do you think there are other people","who might like the idea that you came up with?"],"1481":["When you have creative ideas like that,","hacking can actually allow you to","change the way a system works,","and that means you can change a game","and how the game is played,","and then you can share that with your friends","and other people who like that game.","Once I started learning how to do it,","I found that, things that were harder for me,","I could make easier."],"1482":["I don't think my parents knew,","but when my parents found out that I was doing it for good,","I think they were happy."],"1483":["Do you do anything with computers or any coding?"],"1484":["[Samy] Interesting, so it's like a graphical interface","where you can connect different pieces together.","Kinda like wire them together."],"1485":["Oh, that's pretty cool.","What do you know about computer hacking?"],"1486":["So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing","is actually building a game","or that they have a game and then you can actually","rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that.","Is that right?"],"1487":["Okay. With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing.","Really, you have some sort of system","and you have a bunch of inputs","and you have some sort of output,","and actually you, as the designer,","you're essentially designing games and software.","You're saying, well,","I will only allow a user to really control these inputs.","Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?"],"1488":["Yep, there's also things like your mouse","and there's even things like the microphone itself","is actually an input device.","It's taking something from you,","which is the sound and it's then transmitting that,","ad it's actually sending it to me.","Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer?","You can give it information."],"1489":["That's absolutely another input","that exists on your computer.","That's how I try to think of things","is there's just a bunch of inputs.","Often, if you're trying to break something","or hack something, you're really saying, okay,","how can I control these inputs in a way that","wasn't necessarily expected?"],"1490":["Typically, it's going to be something","like the keyboard, right?","I'm just going to be typing keystrokes","to be talking to some piece of software or hardware,","but other times it can be other things","like even the temperature of a computer","can actually affect how the computer operates,","and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer","and actually slow down the movement of electrons in","something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off,","it stores something that wasn't memory like a password","and stores it for a long enough time","that I might be able to actually","extract it through some other methods."],"1491":["It just depends what you're trying to do.","In some cases, it could literally be seconds","because you already know how the system works,","and other times, it could be years.","So what have you learned about hacking?"],"1492":["Have you started studying cybersecurity?"],"1493":["Have you heard of the breach of Target","where they were breached many years ago","and their point of sale systems were hacked?"],"1494":["So where people are swiping credit cards,","those credit card numbers were stolen.","They hired a company to come in","and perform a penetration test to see,","can the good guys essentially break in again","to prevent this sort of thing in the future?","And when this team came in,","they found they actually were able","to get pretty much to the same point of sale system,","and the way they did that was by exploiting","an internet-connected deli meat scale.","Once the company was able to essentially","get into the deli scale,","because the deli scale was on the internal network,","then they were able to really escalate privilege and find","a vulnerability within another system.","Essentially, that just got them into the network.","and once you're in the network,","it's often really easy to then escalate from there."],"1495":["Yeah, that's another interesting concept.","It's really just different layers","that we have for protection,","because often when you're talking about","something like a corporate network,","or even your home network,","you typically have sort of one level of defense, right?","If someone can break that","or it can get in through some other system","that is connected or exposes","some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right?","You can connect to a Bluetooth device","without being on the wireless network,","without being on the LAN.","That potentially gives you another place","that you can pivot on and then access other devices,","because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi,","well, if you can get in through Bluetooth,","then you can then access the Wi-Fi","and get to other devices on the network.","Are you familiar with buffer overflows?"],"1496":["If we were to write a program that asked for your name","and you typed in your name,","but before you could type in your name,","in a low leveling, which is like C or C++,","you'd have to allocate some memory.","So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes","because whose name is going to be longer","than a hundred bytes or a hundred character?","But what happens if you were to not really check","that they limited to a hundred bytes?","Do you know what happens if they essentially","start typing over that hundred bytes?"],"1497":["Absolutely, you would essentially cause","a segmentation fault."],"1498":["But what's really cool about that is,","when you're going into memory,","you're starting to cross over","that boundary of that hundred byte allocation,","and now you're starting to write over additional memory.","That other memory is really important stuff.","So you have your name, the hundred bytes there,","and then right next to your name is the return address,","and that's the address that the code is gonna execute","and it's going to return to after that function is done,","and it's going to jump to that address,","but after you type your hundred bytes,","the next few bites that you type,","you're actually going to overwrite that return address.","So that return address could essentially be","another address in memory.","So what you end up doing is you type a name","and it's not really a name, it's really just code.","And that code, you keep typing until","you get to the return address,","and you start typing an address,","which is really the beginning of your name","and your computer or your processor","is actually going to read that address","and it will jump back to the beginning","and then execute that payload.","So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was","super exciting to me when I started","learning about really reverse engineering."],"1499":["Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago,","there been a lot of protection mechanisms","built to make it difficult to exploit.","More and more, we're actually using","smaller and smaller computers","with smaller amounts of compute power.","If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers","that are all running there.","So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system","that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows.","So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while","adding layers of protection to prevent malice","and these types of attacks?","Sometimes it actually is,","how can we write software","or how can we build a system","that prevents these types of attacks from entering?","But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find","new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of?","What got you interested in computer science","and information security?"],"1500":["You brought up China and Iran,","and something that's interesting about those areas","is really censorship, right?","They have essentially censored internet.","In the US, we have a really interesting","internal struggle here where we actually have","government agencies like the state department","that are funding software to evade censorship,","like Tor and other mechanisms.","While then we also have an internal struggle where we have","other organizations like the NSA","who are specifically looking to break that exact same system","that the US government is also funding."],"1501":["It's good for us to understand","how these systems can really break down.","Although, I think one thing that I see","is that some of, let's say,","the organizations that are looking to break this","are not necessarily going to share","once they actually learn that information.","They might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket","and use it when it's advantageous to them."],"1502":["What kind of projects are you working on?"],"1503":["So essentially it's a really,","definitely a stripped down operating system,","or I guess it's a virtual machine."],"1504":["Have you done any work in side channel analysis?"],"1505":["So the side channel analysis is really looking","not at a vulnerability within a system,","but really unintended consequences","of what the system is built on.","A very simple example of a side channel","is putting your ear to the ground to hear if","there are horses coming towards you,","and the same thing applies to technology.","So you can have something like","a CPU, it's executing instructions,","certain instructions that use a little bit more power,","and power is reserved in these capacitors,","which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU.","And as they're pulling power,","there's something in physics called","the electrostrictive effect","where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount.","And then although we can't hear it,","the microphone on a mobile device","can actually listen to that.","If you then listen to that and you say,","oh, I see a pattern here,","and you can go all the way down","and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key,","even though it could be argued that","the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it."],"1506":["Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency","of the underlying transistors and capacitors","that are holding that storage.","That's crazy.","I think the first time I heard of","an interesting attack like that was learning","about the cold boot attack.","Being able to, you know,","someone enters their password on their computer","and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away.","Being able to extract that password is really difficult.","If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory,","put it in my own device,","except the problem is memory is volatile,","so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out.","You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down,","cool that computer, make it real nice and cool.","Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory,","put into your own device, extract the memory,","and then you're good.","It's such a simple method to really","extract something kind of critical.","Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability","and you could argue that it's not necessarily","a vulnerability in the architecture itself,","but rather exploitation of physics at that point."],"1507":["I keep forgetting to update my fridge."],"1508":["That's pretty challenging","if you want to use wireless, right?","If you wanna use a wireless router."],"1509":["The risk right now, just during this quarantine,","is actually massive now that we think about it,","because you might have these legacy systems.","You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago,","and it's too costly to upgrade,","but now you can't actually have a lot of people","in a single location, so potentially,","they actually do have to now add some sort of","remote capabilities to these systems","that were never meant to be on the internet.","Have you ever had any ethical concerns","with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?"],"1510":["Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies","who are trying to make it illegal for you","to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right?","Something that you actually own."],"1511":["What if it were illegal?","Would you then do it?","Fortunately it's not today, right?","It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts,","none of that has been passed,","but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it,","but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean."],"1512":["But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone.","I ethically think similar to you in that, you know,","what is moral to me is","as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others,

yourself","for the people watching?"],"1515":["What have you been up to?","And yeah, what are you working on?"],"1516":["Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours,","Jasper gave a example of fault

inputs","that you're used to","and you've now controlled the environment","in a advantageous way to the user or the player.","Can you give an example of some type of fault injection","that you're doing or working on?"],"1517":["We're also scratching the surface of,","like, what is possible?","It's not necessarily just the system itself","and not necessarily that algorithm itself.","Like you said, you don't necessarily","need to attack the math in some cases.","You can just attack that check.","And I think something that's been pretty cool","is looking at higher energy particles.","It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm,","but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see.","Like, I want to see one of these faults","because I haven't seen it myself.","And also, how do you know that you've seen it?","I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber.","A cloud chamber lets you actually view","high energy particles going through","sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol.","And I thought it'd be really cool","if we put some memory chip in there,","like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data,","but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch.","Assuming that there is a high energy particle","that actually hits that memory,","that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit.","The outside microcontrollers","should be able to read that and actually say,","Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data,","I'm only reading data,","and we should be able to visibly or optically see it.","What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research?","Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at","intentionally injecting high energy particles","to take over a computer, when really, you know,","that's another technique for fault injection,","technically speaking."],"1518":["You mean flipping bits within flash?"],"1519":["I've never seen...","Maybe call it a verifiable

can happen to a computer chip,","but I've never seen both."],"1520":["The thing is, even if you know about that,","then there's so many others that","someone won't necessarily know about,","because there's so many, I guess,","potential areas for a fault to occur.","Where do you think security is going","or new research is going?","Are there any new areas you think","are coming out or are going to be more interesting,","you know, pretty soon?"],"1521":["For me, I think the things that have been","recent and super interesting","are typically down to physics-level effects","that maybe we haven't seen before.","I think my mind was blown with the,","there was the light commands research,","and they were able to modulate sound,","although it's purely over light using a laser,","they would hit the MEMS microphone,","and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it","and essentially take control over light."],"1522":["It's the easier side.","I would say my side is the

much going on","in the world of computers and that's what fascinated me."],"1552":["There are a lot of ethical questions","about whether we should be intervening in other countries,","but it's pretty interesting that","two different agencies of the government","are actually working on contrasting technology.","I can actually understand that because","if we are creating a technology","that we are going to deploy somewhere else,","we should know its limitations.","We should know how to control it."],"1553":["This is the end of my first year.","I'm a PhD student at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.","I'm studying security systems and operating systems.","So, security for operating systems.","I've been mostly working on a project","that limits executables' exposure to bugs in the kernel.","It's run by professor Justin Cappos there.","He found that the majority of bugs","that occur in the Linux kernel","happen when you're doing things that","people don't do that often,","the programs don't do that often.","So designing a runtime environment that lets you","limit what a certain program has access to,","but also the things that it does have access to","is also limited to those popular paths in the kernel.","So it can't access areas that aren't under more scrutiny."],"1554":["Basically, we're creating a user space operating system."],"1555":["Like, a little bit.","I read the Rowhammer paper.","I found it really interesting,","but it's nothing that I've actually worked with."],"1556":["So all memory devices are just,","it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows.","They basically all hold different pieces of memory.","That's all the gates are.","Either they're turned on or they're turned off.","So what Rowhammer found was they tested","a bunch of different memory devices and found that","by doing a certain order of storing things,","and then pulling that information back in a certain way","in one place would actually flip gates in a different place.","So you could actually do a bunch of things","to a piece of memory that had nothing to do with","something that may be critical in a different place","and actually change its contents,","and that obviously exposes all sorts of security issues,","because that's very hard to predict."],"1557":["I've spent a decent amount of time with this stuff,","and in my mind, a lot of that is a

owning like smart things."],"1559":["Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials,","but yeah, no matter what,","you can't really avoid any of this."],"1560":["Oh yeah, for sure.","When people find vulnerabilities,","I think it's their duty to release those to the public."],"1561":["Yeah, I think that's nuts.","I'm firmly against that for sure."],"1562":["I don't know, probably,

purely the research side,","but also how much should you care about it."],"1566":["One of them was looking at, like,","a little hardware Bitcoin wallet,","and you could use fault injection","to actually recover secrets from it,","and a lot of devices.","I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right?","Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate,","and it's supposed to run","some really crazy math that authenticates it,","but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math,","you just attack the check at the end."],"1567":["This was actually tied into something recently","I was looking at, which was, you know,","flipping flash and EPROM memory."],"1568":["Yeah, exactly, right.","So flipping it in this sort of flash memory.","And so someone's done it with x-rays.","There's actually, I forget who now.","There's a paper, at least one,","and it's just like a little plate they make","with like a hole in it to concentrate the x-ray source","and it works, so yeah, it's super interesting.","Like, one bit in memory means a lot,","especially in the flash memory side.","Yeah, visualizing it would be cool though."],"1569":["Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned,","like, making it more obvious.","I mean, staying on fault injection right now,","this is lately what I've been up to.","A lot of making a little kind of, you know,","like electronics kits of old, right?","And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works.","So making something like that for fault injection.","So all kind of older logic and stuff like that.","So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like,","you're presented the little MUX chip.","You know, voltage switcher.","That sort of idea, using just discreet logic","to generate the actual glitch itself.","So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right?","It's like people don't know about it sometimes.","Like, even engineers designing systems.","It's new to a lot of people."],"1570":["Fault injection has become pretty interesting.","Like, there's been a lot of people poking at that,","and I think a lot more products of interest.","Side channel still might have a bit of a comeback.","Basically, what I kind of see is","a lot of the really cool stuff has been in academia","because product security hasn't kept up, right?","For the longest time, doing these attacks on hardware","was pretty straightforward.","You didn't need these crazy attacks.","It looks like a lot of devices are coming out now","that actually have real claims to security, right?","More than just a data sheet mentioned.","There's actually something behind it."],"1571":["I'm curious of the backstory to how they found that.","Because if you told me that, right?","So you said like, Hey, Colin, you should test this out.","I probably would be like, It probably won't even work.","Which is like a lot of side channels.","When I first heard about it, you know,","working, doing firmware stuff, it was like,","Oh, that sounds like it's not gonna work.","Like, that sounds impossible.","You know, the whole area of hardware hacking,","it feels kinda like cheating because, you know, as you said,","someone designing the system needs to know about","so many different ways, right?","So there's so many ways to break the system,","and if you're designing them, you need to know all of them,","but when you're attacking it,","you really need to know one, right?","So I can know nothing about, like,","how does ECC actually work?","You know, I have some vague hand-waving","I can tell you about, but if you gave me a pen","and told me, like, Okay, write it down,","specifically the equations and what they mean","and how the point model works and stuff.","Right, no idea, but designers are like the other side.","It's

been challenged to explain one concept at five levels of increasing complexity.","My topic is blockchain technology.","Blockchain is a new network, and it's going to help us decentralize trade, allowing us to do a lot of our transactions much more peer to peer directly and lower our use of intermediaries like companies or banks maybe.","I think today everyone can leave understanding something about blockchain at some level."],"1":["Do you know what we're gonna talk about today?","It's called blockchain."],"2":["That's a really good question.","It's actually a way that we can trade.","Do you know what trade is?"],"3":["When you give up most of what you want?","Well, sometimes that definitely happens for sure.","What if I told you that this is the kind of technology that I work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world?"],"4":["Yeah."],"5":["That's probably a good idea, maybe somebody else likes it more than you do.","So normally, when people trade, they have to go to the store, or they have to know the person so they can get what they asked for.","With blockchain, you can make that exact same trade, but you don't need the store, and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person."],"6":["Really."],"7":["[Bettina] So Ian, do you know what blockchain is?"],"8":["Have you ever traded or sold anything?"],"9":["That's amazing.","What made you decide to trade on eBay?"],"10":["So what if I told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing, but it goes to you and I directly?","You wouldn't need an eBay or a brand in between."],"11":["And there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today, right?","We have a lot of banks."],"12":["We have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen, but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of a technological trust, then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between."],"13":["It's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions.","And so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information, the same sort of list is held by all these different people.","Like, you could have it on your computer.","And then it gets validated by everyone, and basically, that turns into the next part of the list.","So it's sort of constantly updating itself."],"14":["So it use cryptography, and that helps it basically encode all of the transactions.","So you can't really see exactly what happened, but you can know it happened because it's like a marker."],"15":["Yeah, exactly."],"16":["[Bettina] Exactly."],"17":["So it's kinda this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded, but instead of being owned by one company, it's owned by everybody."],"18":["Yeah."],"19":["We're gonna talk about blockchain technology.","Have you heard of blockchain?"],"20":["When we were much smaller societies, you and I could trade in our community pretty easily.","As the distance in our trade grew, we ended up inventing institutions, right?","If you Uber or you use Airbnb or you use Amazon even, these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value.","But today, we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one to one but at scale, and it's called blockchain technology.","There is some kind of interface for it.","You could have an app, or you could use a computer to do it, but instead of there being a company in the middle that's helping you make that transaction, it's a bunch of software code."],"21":["And so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node.","So they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions as they happen."],"22":["In some cases, yeah, it is.","And a lot of people in the financial industry, in particular, are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like Bitcoin or other tokens that are easier to use instead of today's currency.","A lot of people think about blockchain as Bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot, and it's this new cryptocurrency.","And it's kind of exciting.","But we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side.","They're more around, how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using this same technology."],"23":["So today, a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchains.","And one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute.","So your government could sign that you have a US passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student.","And you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis."],"24":["So today, we're gonna talk about blockchain technology."],"25":["[Bettina] Have you ever heard of blockchain?"],"26":["Yeah, that's exactly right.","And you can append it.","You can sort of add new information that's more current, but you can't actually go erase anything."],"27":["For sure.","A lot of the assumptions won't hold true."],"28":["Same with, who are the actors?","It's not just people anymore.","It's machines."],"29":["We're gonna have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us, too.","What kind of barriers or road blocks would you imagine are gonna happen in the blockchain space?"],"30":["Yeah.","One of the problems that Bitcoin has faced is Bitcoins getting stolen or lost.","But a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize Bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target."],"31":["Yeah.","To actually transition into the mainstream and make it useful for average people to use, we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education, a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of a user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable.","What is the current state of blockchain in your understanding?","What's gonna have to happen next?"],"32":["Well, we have a lot of public blockchains.","Like we have Bitcoin.","We have the Ethereum network and XT, but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains, so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network where people feel comfortable using it.","And some are also proof of concept out in the real world, projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments.","And we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade."],"33":["So tell me your version of a technical definition of blockchain."],"34":["So it randomizes?"],"35":["Do you see it as defining a new discipline of kinds, or where are we gonna see blockchain emerge in the real world first?"],"36":["Sure, and people are working on that already."],"37":["A lot of people are seeing blockchain in the news and maybe seeing a lot of sort of initial coin offerings (laughs) and sort of monetization opportunity around blockchain and getting very excited about it.","And some of that excitement is real and should be, you know, encouraged, but some of it is also hype.","How do you feel about the hype cycle around blockchain today?"],"38":["And it also creates a problem, which is people get a lot of excitement around it."],"39":["And then they're waiting for the world to change, right?"],"40":["Where is this technology?","Why haven't I seen any change yet?"],"41":["And it's because we've had a lot of PR, a lot of proof of concept, but truthfully, this is more like a science, right?"],"42":["It will develop.","It will take five years.","It will take 10 years.","That kind of time is necessary.","One of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're not just gonna see blockchain emerge.","We're gonna see artificial intelligence continue to evolve.","We're gonna see connective devices and this sort of growing internet of things and machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own.","And so I actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable, verifiable trust."],"43":["[Bettina] Right."],"44":["Yeah."],"45":["So a barrier being sort of a rigidity in structures that maybe don't accommodate real-life scenarios very well."],"46":["The system we have today is also broken.","(laughs) Right?"],"47":["In that it's hard to compare it to some perfect future.","Just like you compare autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it.","It should be perfect.","There should be zero car deaths."],"48":["When you say, well, there's hundreds of thousands, millions of car deaths on the road due to human error today.","I think we're in a similar place.","We're going to see problems with this technology, and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility.","But it's going to also be a version, a system, that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today."],"49":["Blockchain may sound complicated, but at it's core, it's just another tool for humans and eventually robots and other kinds of identities to trade at scale and make that trade more decentralized.","And it's part of our future, so it's important that people have these kinds of conversations and start to learn about it."],"50":["What's blockchain?"],"51":["Mmm-hmm, it's when you take turns doing something.","It's when you give up most of what you want, right?"],"52":["Really?"],"53":["If I could trade with any kid, I would trade, well, I would trade something I don't like so much."],"54":["Really?"],"55":["No."],"56":["Actually, I'm selling my computer on eBay right now."],"57":["Well, I mean, I've heard of it, and I trust it a lot because they have all of their guarantees, so I know that I'm gonna get money and the person's gonna get what they want."],"58":["That's cool."],"59":["Yeah."],"60":["So how does it work?"],"61":["So like, how do you make sure that it's secure?"],"62":["So you could kind of like, I don't know, say trade apples, but you would just see like random letters for it?"],"63":["So you wouldn't be able to track it, I guess?"],"64":["That's cool."],"65":["That's cool."],"66":["I've heard of the words blockchain, but I'm not sure I know what it is."],"67":["Okay."],"68":["I mean, I would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen."],"69":["Is there a mechanism for verifying that person A is a legitimate seller or producer of the item?"],"70":["Okay."],"71":["I have.","Whenever we have a transaction, and let's say I buy something from you, this information gets logged.","And it gets verified by a third person or third party.","And then if like all this information verified and it all matches, right, the transaction goes through without any intermediary basically, right?","It gets stored, and when you make further transactions, this information is ready, embedded.","It's in the ledger."],"72":["Absolutely.","The way the technology's changing, nothing's gonna be like it used to be.","And there's no like firm, and then the buyer and the seller, it basically, we'll have to rewrite a lot of rules in economics as well."],"73":["Absolutely."],"74":["[Valentinas] Absolutely."],"75":["So at least when we talk about Bitcoin, there are some trust issues and some hacks.","So there's obviously a need to work on trust and feeling that it's a safe technology."],"76":["Absolutely, so education will be a big part before we actually can use the technology in a wide sense.","Right?"],"77":["The current state is in the research state, and it's being developed to be applied in many, many areas.","It must be used almost everywhere to where we won't even imagine how we lived without it.","But I'm not sure where it's going to go.","I mean, no one really knows, right."],"78":["A technical definition of blockchain is that it is a persistent, transparent, public, append-only ledger.","So it is a system that you can add data to and not change previous data within it.","It does this through a mechanism for creating consensus between scattered, or distributed, parties that do not need to trust each other but just need to trust the mechanism by which their consensus is arrived at.","In the case of blockchain, it relies on some form of challenge such that no one actor on the network is able to solve this challenge consistently more than everyone else on the network."],"79":["Yes, it randomizes the process and, in theory, ensures that no one can force the blockchain to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with, one that relies on a mechanism for a peer to peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and then verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter after the fact."],"80":["I mean, just like an example, one thing that I think about a lot in terms of possible blockchain applications is electricity, right.","The next generation of distributed smart grid technology effectively--"],"81":["Yeah, yeah, exactly.","And it's this very fruitful area of research, and you can find yourself looking like 20 years out, right, where you have an enormous number of electric cars.","You have all of these batteries.","That's essentially a distributed peak load power grid, right.","Like, the cars are getting plugged in and unplugged at different times.","If you have a mechanism that's able to automatically and autonomously be distributing power based on batteries that are scattered throughout the grid that are being used for other purposes.","Their owners don't even necessarily need to be aware.","I mean, to have something that looks like a much more viable society that still has a lot of electricity needs but is able to base that much more on renewables, is able to make up the difference during peak load periods or during differences in weather, that is able to have power much closer to where it is needed rather than having to be distributed over great distances.","It's like, that's something that would be an enormously hard problem to solve.","And it's not that the blockchain makes it easy, but it makes it possible."],"82":["I'm glad you mentioned initial coin offerings because for me, those really exemplify the sort of problem that we're having at this exact moment.","They are an idea with enormous potential significance down the road.","However, the promise of the initial coin offering has been kind of hijacked into this string of like basically pump and dump scams or sort of desperate gold rush schemes.","The faster that we can shift from this fantasy that it is going to make you rich in a sort of, you know, 1920s tulip bubble kind of way, is the sooner that we can get into people, honestly, and I mean this like with all the hope in the world, people being disappointed in blockchain.","It's like, oh, I didn't get rich.","It's just being used now to make it easier to transact goods and services safely across borders.","This isn't exciting at all.","And then we'll see that become part of the everyday infrastructure of the world in a way that I think will be very significant.","But I think it is now, almost every aspect of it that's connected with the concept of money is wildly over-hyped, and--"],"83":["[Finn] Yes."],"84":["[Finn] Yeah, yeah."],"85":["(laughs) Yes, yes, yes."],"86":["Yes."],"87":["Yes, and one of the most interesting ideas to me that came out of the currency side of the blockchain project was the notion around like coloring coins, right, assign properties to a particular coin, and in particular to assign those properties in ways that would allow you to do things like bring in the graph of previous transactions."],"88":["You know, there's sort of an obvious application for this, which is something that would look a little bit like an extreme version of like a boycott divestment and sanctions kind of approach, right, a model where it's sort of a like I will not touch money.","My wallet will automatically not touch money that has been exchanged with the following as a sort of very extreme way of cutting those things out.","But there's also ways in which, I think, that could be applied to clearing out the entire logistics process of many kinds of bad actors.","Trying to make a supply chain better, in some ways, relies a lot on whose version of better that is and exactly kind of what gets qualified but also how that is quantified within say some kind of like smart contract system.","There's multiple ways that I can see this backfiring.","One is the ways in which that is implemented, for example, leaving certain kinds of bad behavior untouched or unanalyzed.","Or one that feels even more dire to me in some ways is creating an extremely inflexible, like 'cause human contracts, legal contracts, are actually very flexible.","There's a lot of kind of room to renegotiate.","There's lots of conditions."],"89":["But we already have real world versions of some of these nightmare scenarios where like your kid has a medical emergency and you can't unlock your car because you're two days behind on payments for it, and so the car system will no longer respond to the app mechanism that you're supposed to be able to use to drive it."],"90":["As you and I have been talking, one of the things that keeps coming up is that we tend to hold novel technologies to an unrealistically high standard in terms of what they are supposed to deliver rather than comparing them to actually existing systems where we can begin to see the possibility that even like a slight incremental improvement would still be an enormous gain."],"91":["Yes."],"92":["(laughs) Yeah."],"93":["Hello everybody.","My name is Jacob Collier and I'm a musician.","I've been challenged today to explain one simple concept in five levels of increasing complexity.","My topic, harmony.","I'm positive that everybody can leave this video with some understanding at some level."],"94":["Bodhi, how's it going?"],"95":["Cool.","So do you know what harmony is?"],"96":["Yeah, that's 100% correct.","Have you ever heard a song called Amazing Grace?"],"97":["It's a good one.","The melody on its own just goes.","(hums Amazing Grace) That melody on its own is kind of lonely, right?","And no one really knows how it feels.","(plays and hums Amazing Grace) So which one did you prefer?"],"98":["[Jacob] Awesome.","And why did you prefer that one?"],"99":["Yeah, ah, that's great.","I can decide how I want this melody to feel and the more notes there are, the more exciting it is.","That's what musical harmony is.","Does that make sense?"],"100":["You're the best."],"101":["Have you ever heard of harmony?"],"102":["Okay, so what do you think harmony is?"],"103":["I like it.","That's absolutely correct."],"104":["Harmony is about injecting melody with emotion so that ultimately, you leave home and you return home and you've learned something along the way."],"105":["So a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad.","A triad is a three-part harmony, basically.","(keyboard harmonic tone) So that's a triad.","So this triad's called C major."],"106":["So have you ever heard of this idea of like, major chords and minor chords?"],"107":["So this is C major, yeah?","(keyboard music) And then this is C minor.","So the feelings are different, right?"],"108":["[Jacob] Yeah, this one's dark and spooky."],"109":["And how does this one make you feel though?"],"110":["Yeah, I like that, yeah."],"111":["So in Amazing Grace, you start with F. You know, if I go (melodic humming) \u266a How sweet the sound \u266a (scat singing) (laughs) Where am I right now?","I don't know where I am.","(scat singing) And my job is to get back home, but to make this chord make sense."],"112":["So I might go (hums Amazing Grace)"],"113":["(mumbles) thanks."],"114":["Oh, cheers (mumbles)."],"115":["My job as a harmonizer is to find that narrative and make it make sense."],"116":["Cool."],"117":["Right."],"118":["Amazing, that's great."],"119":["Essentially what harmony is, is like a language, right?","And so as with any language, the more words you're capable of speaking in a language, the more you can say.","All right, so in harmony, this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way.","Have you ever heard of the circle of fifths?"],"120":["Okay, that's great.","On one side, we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter, you know, like these kinds of, (keyboard music) these really bright sounds.","And the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center.","So we're home in F, but imagine we're taking a quick visit to B-flat, but then the sun comes out."],"121":["What notes would you suggest I add?"],"122":["F is a great one.","Yeah, and if we keep going in that direction?"],"123":["Yeah."],"124":["You got it.","Ooh!","Yeah?","Yeah, yeah.","So this is really, this is like a gleaming glade or something, you know?","Let's play this tune, Amazing Grace.","Let's play it in its simplest form."],"125":["All right, so we're gonna start in F, right?","Yeah.","So say.","\u266a I once \u266a F, yeah.","(Amazing Grace) B-flat, yeah.","F. C. F. So we're home."],"126":["Nice, okay cool.","Lets try one more version where we add some colors.","Alright so lets visit the B flat, with a bit more imagination."],"127":["Just to see how things feel.","Yeah.","All right, lets do it.","(both playing Amazing Grace) So it's F major seven, but its over A.","Which is F seven over A.","(both playing) B flat major seven with an A and a G in it.","F major seven with an E and a D and a G, yeah.","(laughter) D minor seven with a G in it.","C softs, or minor, nice.","B flat major.","G seven, F sharp major seven.","Home, yeah!","I like that.","So what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories.","Cool, yeah.","Nice, man."],"128":["One nice emotional device when it come to harmony is just thinking about how to arrive somewhere.","You know, it can be so sparse, it can be so rich, and it can be really emotional.","So this idea of the overtone and the undertone in the harmonic series, how much do you know about this?"],"129":["Right."],"130":["Yeah.","The amazing thing about harmony is that it exists in nature.","So, take the harmonic series of the note F, for example.","Okay.","You have the ups on the fifth and the fourth and then the, (hums) That seemed a little bit sharp, but that's fine.","And then tones get increasingly small.","Beneath that note, you have the undertone series, which essentially is like a reflection of something.","In the same way that when a tree grows in nature, you have the branches which grow upwards and the roots which go downwards.","So it's quite a nice thing to thing about, this being the key center, the floor, the ground, and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself, and the differences in the sensations with that.","Lots of the time I think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization, people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes."],"131":["I think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them, just the simple idea of inversion, inversion of the simple triad, of F major.","\u266aI once was lost and now I'm found \u266a \u266a Was blind \u266a \u266a But now I see \u266a Now how home do I want to go here, you know?","Is there another verse to come?"],"132":["Because I can delay the gratification of going home.","First of all, just by using inversions, even before we add the notes to the chord.","One thing that I was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single base note."],"133":["Yeah.","so this is the note F."],"134":["F major, F minor, D flat major seven G flat diminished, G flat minor major seven, G minor seven, G soft, G seven, G seven sharp 11.","And then, G seven with a flat 13"],"135":["That's it!","(laughs) A flat soft, A flat major seven.","A flat major seven sharp five, with a sharp 11.","Essentially, what that demonstrates is that every note and every base note are compatible.","So once we realize this its like, that's great!","Now what should we do?","What, how, what should we, what should we, how, what am I supposed to do?","What to do, right.","And sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging, there are too many options, too many things are possible.","So that's when it becomes super, super important to be aware of what you wanna try and say emotionally."],"136":["So essentially, the way I'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity, you know, between the overtone series and the undertone series, or you know, the one side and the other side.","The perfect and the play goal.","The feeling of a minor perfect-- (keyboard music) Resolving, it's so moving, you know?","And it's a good alternative to something like, (keyboard music)"],"137":["Right."],"138":["Exactly, yeah.","No, for sure.","And, you know, F major can be something you arrive in from, if you arrive in F major from D flat, then it's like the sun's come up."],"139":["But if you arrive in F major from A major, then it's like the sun's gone in."],"140":["So, there's a lot about context, I think.","Once you have a language, it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways.","I think that's what makes the difference."],"141":["A lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life.","They've seen so much harmony, heard so much harmony.","How do you make the choices, there's so much that's possible when you know stuff.","How do you have the courage to make a choice?"],"142":["Yeah, yeah, yeah.","I find it fascinating in music to think about, you know, say I arrive in a place, if I'm going, say I'm going to D flat major.","And there's something you once taught me.","You taught me this song Don't Follow the Crowd."],"143":["And there's that chord.","It's not a Dennerman chord, but it functions as a dominant chord.","But it doesn't matter, because you're still going to the place you're going to."],"144":["It's something like, um... (keyboard music)"],"145":["Yeah.","So this chord being, like a major seven with a sharp five, and a natural, like, there's no dominant thing."],"146":["But at that moment, I'm coming from here, and I wanna forge some, some solution.","I get myself in a situation.","(keyboard music)"],"147":["That haunted me for days."],"148":["'Cause, you know, I just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation.","And there it was!","And, you know, if you read the rule book, it's, that not in it."],"149":["Chris Anderson, yeah, yeah."],"150":["Oh yeah."],"151":["Exactly right, it gets gnarly right?"],"152":["Yeah.","But if you verse that correctly, then you're safe."],"153":["You can get away with it."],"154":["Yeah.","Oh yeah.","(keyboard music)"],"155":["Yeah."],"156":["Yeah."],"157":["Right, right, right."],"158":["Something like that.","And that's not 'cause like emotionally, it's almost like I'm here, I'm arriving here.","But, if the base note is the same, it's like this inevitability about it, it's like I was there all along."],"159":["Yeah, yeah.","It's like one thing is moving in one direction and one thing has arrived, so it's this tension and it's glorious.","I love thinking about these things emotionally, just because that's a feeling, I know that feeling in my life."],"160":["(Jacob) No."],"161":["Yeah.","Was there ever a point in your life when you were younger where you felt like you had consistently fell back into the same habits?"],"162":["I don't want to play this same thing again."],"163":["So you thought he said butter."],"164":["And he said bottom.","But you thought he said butter."],"165":["Wow."],"166":["Wow."],"167":["That's amazing."],"168":["I've been using this tune Amazing Grace."],"169":["And so, we could play a bit of that if you want to.","And we could talk about some stuff.","I've been doing it in F. (keyboards playing Amazing Grace) (laughing) Thanks Herbie, that was a trip."],"170":["Good."],"171":["It's when people sing together and it sounds nice."],"172":["No."],"173":["The second one."],"174":["Because it sounds better."],"175":["Mm-hmm."],"176":["Thank you!"],"177":["Yes."],"178":["I think basically it's like, one person has the lower voice and then like, girl usually has the higher voice and then they blend it together."],"179":["Okay."],"180":["Yeah."],"181":["Okay."],"182":["Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."],"183":["Yeah, feels like dark and spooky."],"184":["Haunted house."],"185":["Happy.","And joyful."],"186":["Yeah, yeah."],"187":["Yeah."],"188":["Oh man, that sounded really good."],"189":["I was surprised."],"190":["That was like, happened."],"191":["That was interesting."],"192":["'Cause I didn't think that that would work together."],"193":["Because there were two two completely different sounds, but then, like, it just made it happen and it just was like, pow!"],"194":["Magic!"],"195":["Mm-hmm."],"196":["Oh, yeah, yeah."],"197":["F."],"198":["C?"],"199":["And then G."],"200":["Yeah."],"201":["Yeah."],"202":["Yeah."],"203":["Awesome."],"204":["Only until I started listening to singing, like barbershop quartet, and, and as I was a violinist as well--"],"205":["Then I finally understood the idea where the overtone series came from that if a bunch of singers were to nail a chord or have it perfectly tuned, the overtones, you would hear a tone that necessarily wasn't being produced by one the singers."],"206":["Yeah."],"207":["Right."],"208":["Would you care to demonstrate that?"],"209":["Yeah."],"210":["(laughs)"],"211":["But what about negative harmony, the dark side?"],"212":["It's funny, you know, you doing that makes something in a major key sound like kind of a wistful sad song."],"213":["You know, you changed the feeling of it, what otherwise would, you know, if you were to tell a kid that this is a major song, we should be happy."],"214":["Right."],"215":["Interesting."],"216":["All right."],"217":["It comes from just your life experience.","And that moves you in a certain direction.","How it gets expressed, many times, is sudden.","Complete surprise.","(laughs)"],"218":["Oh, yeah."],"219":["Right, right, right."],"220":["Right, right, right, right."],"221":["Right, right."],"222":["Yeah.","Right."],"223":["(Herbie laughs)"],"224":["Yeah, and this is what I learned from the great Chris Anderson."],"225":["The idea of going to a D flat chord.","Normally it does a dominant like the A flat seven.","But back in the 20s, they also used to do things like, (keyboard music)"],"226":["So, It's always coming.","(keyboard music) Coming from just below the key.","From C with a seventh.","And when we don't normally say a C seventh and an A flat seventh are related, you know, 'cause so many of the notes are different.","You've got this, and you've got a G--"],"227":["Yeah, right."],"228":["Oh yeah, you can get all of those notes."],"229":["Yeah.","(laughs) The other thing that I like, that we both do on occasion, is to be on the chord we want to arrive at with the bottom part of our structure.","And the chord before the arrival chord, to have that on top."],"230":["Yeah."],"231":["Right."],"232":["And it makes like a pull."],"233":["Music is not different from life."],"234":["You know, and I think that's probably the greatest attraction to those of us who play music."],"235":["You'd find, man,"],"236":["I had a really great experience when I was working with Miles Davis.","I felt like I was in a rut playing the same stuff, and I was getting depressed because of it.","And Myles said something to me.","I thought he said, Don't play the butter notes.","And so, I thought, what did he mean by that?"],"237":["Butter notes, right."],"238":["Yeah."],"239":["And so, I started thinking, oh great, what could butter be?","What is butter?","Then I started thinking, what are the obvious notes?","For example in a chord.","The obvious notes are the third and the seventh.","So I said, maybe if I leave those out.","It changed everything for me, from that moment on.","I got more applause for that solo than I did the whole week.","(Herbie laughs)"],"240":["I wouldn't play the voice things I play today if that had not happened."],"241":["I know."],"242":["Oh, right."],"243":["Yeah, thank you."],"244":["My name's Aric Prather and I'm a sleep scientist at UCSF.","I study the causes and consequences of insufficient sleep, and I also carry out interventions to improve sleep among people with insomnia.","Today, I've been challenged to explain the topic of sleep at five different levels.","Everybody knows a little bit about what is happening when they sleep, but I think they'll be surprised that there's a lot of science in there."],"245":["Hey Christopher.","And how old are you?"],"246":["What grade is that?"],"247":["You think fifth?","What is your favorite subject?"],"248":["Well that's awesome, because we're going to be talking about science today."],"249":["And you know what we're going to be talking about?"],"250":["Sleep."],"251":["Mine too, because I get to spend all day studying it.","Because you know what sleep does for you?"],"252":["[laughs] That's exactly right.","It kinda is like recharging your battery, right?","And sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body and our mind, right?","It plays a really important way that we learn, and it helps us kind of recover from the day before.","It affects our immune system and our metabolism, all of these things that we need to kinda be healthy."],"253":["So today, we're going to talk about some animals and how they sleep.","So here's the first one.","What's that?"],"254":["Have you ever seen a giraffe in person?"],"255":["They're pretty cool, right?"],"256":["And so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else, and so the way that it does is it kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball, but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day.","30 minutes!","Because it can't waste any more time, because it can't be vulnerable for any longer.","It can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing.","It has kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time."],"257":["So we think it works the same way, but maybe just like more efficiently.","And so we're still really learning about how this works.","Sleep science itself is kind of a new field."],"258":["And how did you feel?"],"259":["Really tired.","Do you think you were a little crankier than usual?","Yeah.","That's actually really interesting, because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually, and so you can't stay up indefinitely, right?","What do you think happens if you don't sleep?"],"260":["Excellent.","So now I want to tell you about another animal and how they sleep, okay?","So we have this one.","What's that?"],"261":["A hippopotamus.","They have a different challenge.","They sleep underwater."],"262":["Right, right!","So how do they do it?","In the area that they live in, they need to stay cool, right?","And so they spend a lot of time in the water, and so then as a consequence, they need to sleep in the water, but how do they do it?","So it's really fascinating.","What they do is while they're sleeping, they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up.","They're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe, because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need.","It's a really amazing thing.","What do you think?"],"263":["Would it be cool to have that power?"],"264":["So now I want to talk about our last animal, and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all.","Okay, so what's this?"],"265":["A dolphin!","Yes.","So dolphins, kind of like hippos, have to sleep in the water, okay?","But because they're mammals, right, they need to breathe.","Dolphins breathe air.","They have to go up to the surface and breathe, right?","And for an animal like that, it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive, right?","You know how dolphins sleep?"],"266":["One half of their brain at a time.","So half of their brain goes to sleep, and the other half stays awake, so that they can continue to breathe and swim, and they do it in this four hours a time, so like their right part of their brain sleeps, they're able to go up to the surface and breathe.","Then their left part of their brain sleeps for four hours, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, so they can kind of maintain alertness, still breathe, and survive.","Is that amazing or what?"],"267":["So what'd you learn today?"],"268":["What is important about sleeping?"],"269":["Hey, I'm Aric."],"270":["And how old are you, Dwayne?"],"271":["Okay, and where do you go to school?"],"272":["Excellent, and what's your favorite subject?"],"273":["That's a serious science."],"274":["And good news, we're talking about science today."],"275":["In fact, we're talking about sleep."],"276":["And sleep science.","Do you sleep?"],"277":["You try, we all gotta try.","You've probably heard about sleep as this kind of, you know, it's a biological process that happens in your brain.","It's really important for your body, but it's a lot more complex than that.","Sleep is made up of different parts.","You know, when you think about sleep, what do you think about?"],"278":["But being off is not just being off.","There's lots of things that are happening.","We're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep."],"279":["So our sleep is made up of different types, okay?","The first one is called non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM, okay?","Or NREM.","And then the other one, which might not be a surprise, is called REM.","Rapid eye movement sleep.","And those are the two main types of sleep that happen.","The way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is that we'll actually bring people into the lab where they can do this at home, where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping, and that allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night."],"280":["When we measure all of that, we're able to see how much time someone's asleep, and how many times they wake up and stuff during the night.","You know, we're also really interested in kind of, the amount of non-REM sleep someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets, because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body.","And so it's important to get both of those.","And so within non-REM sleep, there are three stages ranging from N-1 to N-2 to N-3.","So not particularly clever in our naming, but that's how we know what stages they are.","And what they do is it moves from lightest to deepest sleep, okay?","N-1, it's more kind of light, wakefulness sleep, kind of in and out of sleeping.","Then you go into N-2, which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep.","And it's more this kind of light sleep, but then we get into kind of the really restorative sleep, and that's N-3.","And in N-3, when we look at someone's EEG wave, we see these big slow waves, and it's called slow wave sleep.","And so we spend about 20% of our sleep in slow wave sleep, though it can vary on a day to day."],"281":["Okay?","When do you think you experience the most REM?"],"282":["You know, some of that is totally accurate, that like when your brain's more engaged by being on your phone or doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things, it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep.","Most of the REM sleep, this dreaming sleep, happens in the second half of the night."],"283":["Okay?","So we wake up a lot during the night, and we just don't remember it.","And you'll go back down into deep sleep, and then up again into REM, you know, in kinda these cycles."],"284":["Do you ever take naps?"],"285":["Okay.","How long are the naps that you take?"],"286":["One to six hours?","That's a long nap."],"287":["Okay.","Usually we want to keep naps, like 20 to 30 minutes.","When people drop into deep sleep, and then they're woken up out of a nap, most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap, and that's because you've been in deep sleep, and it's this term called sleep inertia.","So what are the stages of sleep?"],"288":["I want to know if you agree, sleep is the coolest thing you've ever heard of."],"289":["So tell me, where are you in school?","What do you study?"],"290":["So pretty science-y."],"291":["Excellent, because today for this level, we're talking about sleep."],"292":["How much sleep do you get, typically?"],"293":["10 hours?"],"294":["Wow."],"295":["And so, how much do you think you need?"],"296":["It turns out, for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65, the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours, and it's really at least seven hours per night, to maintain optimal health as an adult.","So at least seven hours.","When we look at across all of the data that is available on like sleep and health, and sleep and psychiatric illness and those types of things, the largest risk is when people get five hours or less.","What do you think is responsible for driving how much sleep you need, and things like that?"],"297":["Right.","You can do part of this level, and you can do the other part, clearly.","Got some expertise under your belt, and that's awesome, because I think that everyone should know more about sleep.","And so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two independent but related processes and so they have kind of lame names.","Process S and process C, and what you've kind of described is process C, and that's the master clock, right?","And it helps regulate kind of the rhythms like all over your body, all your cells, and all those kind of things.","It drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland, and melatonin comes online under darkness, so when the sun goes down, your brain knows okay it's time to start getting ready for sleep, and so you start releasing melatonin, which really kind of sets the table for sleeping."],"298":["Yeah, no, that's a really great question, and the same is true in places where the sun never goes down during the summer, and when it's dark all the time during the winter, and it turns out light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm.","But I think the thing that's really important, again there are two processes, that the other one is the S process, and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep.","One name we call it is the homeostatic sleep drive.","Kind of the longer you're awake, the sleepier you get.","You stay up, you get sleepy.","Time goes by, you get sleepier.","Time goes by, you get sleepier.","But it's actually kind of a fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated, and it's really kind of akin to like a balloon, okay?","So you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat.","You've kind of like drained out all of the sleepiness.","But then as you kind of go throughout the day, it kind of fills up, so you use your energy, it gets filled up.","And then it gets filled up more as you get towards nighttime, right?","And then when it's at this optimal amount is when you kind of go to sleep and let out all of the sleepiness again.","And this is really what underlies why napping can also be bad for you.","So napping's not inherently bad, but if you actually let out some of this air during the day, it's going to take longer for the balloon to get bigger, right, I see to where you feel sleepy, right?"],"299":["Right."],"300":["What did you learn about sleep today?"],"301":["Hi, I'm Aric."],"302":["Thank you for joining us.","What do you do?","Where are you at in school?"],"303":["Congratulations."],"304":["So a lot of brain stuff."],"305":["Great."],"306":["So that's good, because that's why you're here, and so we're talking about sleep today, and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go through consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition."],"307":["Okay.","The best way to think about this transition is really called, it's a flip flop switch, okay?","So this term comes from engineering, and the idea is that in sleep, you basically have kind of this all of nothing experience.","Certainly people kind of drift off to sleep, but then all of a sudden you're unconscious, right?","So it seems like it's this flip flop between the arousal system and the sleep promoting system, and it's certainly regulated, and we'll get a little bit into that, but they're certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes.","Okay, so we have the ascending reticular activating system.","It originates in the brain stem, and there's a dorsal and a ventral arm to this, and so the dorsal arm has neurons, cholinergic neurons, that go up to the thalamus and then it projections into the fore brain, and then there's the ventral arm, and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons, so there are monominergic, so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray, serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphae nuclei, histaminergic neurons that come from the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hippothalamus, and then noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus, and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain.","So if we just think about drugs that are available inducing wakefulness, we can certainly, kind of the dopaminergic ones jump out, right?","So we have amphetamines that kind of drive those signaling, and then modafinil, which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive day-time sleepiness that maintains alertness throughout the day."],"308":["For the role that they play with respect to the sleep-wake system is really kind of amping up the wake system, right?","And so certainly that has like down stream consequences for the sleep system, because now the flip flop switch is kind of pushed in a much stronger direction, and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to get it pushed back to sleep."],"309":["And do we know much about why, or which stages of the sleep cycle are affected?","You know, if you take amphetamines, is it then when you go to sleep, that you're not able to transition through each of the sleep periods, or is that less clear?"],"310":["You know, so I think that's less clear.","In some ways, you know, getting back to this idea of this wake-sleep system, we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to this wake arousal system, and so the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral pre-optic nucleus, also called VLPO, and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and galanin, which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the wake promoting ones.","And so, it's kind of this delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing.","In your cognitive neuro-science training, right, it sounds like it's pretty specific and focused in a particular part of the brain, the cerebellum, and one thing that I'm interested in is you bring a participant into the study, have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep?","Have you asked them about their sleep?"],"311":["You know, what we do in our studies, is we actually track people, for say a week, and they have to get in within this range of amount of sleep and then it has to be both amount of sleep and how stable it is.","That variability can kind of impact it and certainly might have an impact on the machinery that's happening in the brain."],"312":["Yeah.","So what did you learn about sleep today?"],"313":["So now we have sleep on your brain.","That was all I wanted to hear."],"314":["Good to see you again, Yue."],"315":["Really glad that you could join us.","So we've been talking about sleep today, various levels of complexity.","But now with you, I really want to talk about what do we know about sleep and the aging brain.","Can you tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing in that area?"],"316":["So how strong is the link?"],"317":["So it's interesting, so I also saw that there was also a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk, and in that study, they looked about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis, and they followed them around for 10 years, and you know, when they pulled all the samples together, they found there was a 1.2 fold increased risk for developing all caused dementia, so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia.","When I think about that, I think about how sleep lives in the brain, these neurodegenerative diseases live in the brain, and so what do we know about the causality of this?","Could it be that individuals who have early onset of say, Alzheimer's, have then poor sleep kind of as a consequence of that?"],"318":["So within dementia risk in particular, Alzheimer's for instance, there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology, right?","So there's beta-amyloid which accumulates in the brain, and then there's kind of these tangles, this tauopathies, right?","And so it sounds like sleep seems to be related to the tauopathies.","What about kind of beta-amyloid?"],"319":["Okay, so there is this bio-directional piece, but I think perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in the sleep field, at least in my view, has been understanding the role of sleep and its clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain.","This idea that sleep is kind of the dishwasher of the brain, it seems like, that you know A betta accumulates as we kind of use energy, and you know it's kind of a waste product, and the idea that if you don't clear it out, that it's going to build up and accumulate."],"320":["I'm excited about the future of sleep medicine.","I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences, kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underly some of these things as they relate to disease risk, and what is the true function of sleep, kind of the why we sleep phenomenon, right?"],"321":["So this was certainly a challenge today.","Everyone knew a little bit about sleep, and I think that's great, because sleep is incredibly important, but there was also a lot of misinformation around kind of how sleep works, and people doing sleep behaviors that may not be the most adaptive for them.","We're still uncovering new things every day about how sleep works, but despite that, all of us know that sleep is fundamental to our health, and so I'm excited for sleep to kind of raise its profile among other health behaviors and get the investment and care that it needs."],"322":["Nice to meet you, my name's Christopher."],"323":["I'm ten."],"324":["I think fifth."],"325":["Math and science."],"326":["Cool."],"327":["What?"],"328":["Favorite part of the day."],"329":["It rests your body, like an electric car."],"330":["Whoa."],"331":["A giraffe."],"332":["Uh yeah."],"333":["Mhm."],"334":["And how does it like recharge, like humans?"],"335":["I had a sleepover on Saturday, and I didn't sleep at all."],"336":["Really tired."],"337":["It affects what you can do in your daily life."],"338":["A hippo."],"339":["I could never do that, I would pass out."],"340":["That's cool."],"341":["Uh yeah."],"342":["Aww a dolphin."],"343":["How?"],"344":["That's cool."],"345":["I learned how other animals sleep."],"346":["Sleep rests your body, and you have to rest your body in order to do your daily things in life."],"347":["I'm Dwayne.","Nice to meet you, Aric."],"348":["I'm 16 years old."],"349":["McClymonds High School in Oakland, California."],"350":["AP Chemistry."],"351":["It is."],"352":["Yeah."],"353":["Oh okay."],"354":["I do, I try.","[laughs]"],"355":["Resting, relaxing, really shutting down your brain, taking some time off of a busy schedule and work day."],"356":["Okay."],"357":["Okay.","Are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM?"],"358":["Oh wow."],"359":["Well I've heard that you don't really go into like a deeper sleep, so I'm guessing like N-3, or really any of the N's at all, really, if you are on technology right before you sleep.","And also if there's too much light, or if you're listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that, you're not experiencing deep sleep, right?"],"360":["Oh."],"361":["Oh wow."],"362":["I do."],"363":["Anywhere from between one to six hours."],"364":["It is a long nap."],"365":["So N-1 being like light sleep, still a lot of brain activity going on.","I can imagine that happens right after you fall asleep.","Asleep.","And then N-2 being light, moderate activity in your brain, still sleep, but still kind of consciously aware, and N-3 being the deepest form of sleep."],"366":["It really is.","[laughs] Right now, it definitely is the coolest thing I've ever heard of."],"367":["I'm a fourth year Chemistry student at USF."],"368":["Yes, pretty science-y."],"369":["Great."],"370":["During the summer?","Like 10 hours."],"371":["And during the school year, maybe five?"],"372":["Yeah."],"373":["I mean, I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range."],"374":["I mean, I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland to which kind of secretes melatonin, which tells us when it's time to go to sleep."],"375":["I'm from Hoi, so we have very long days.","We have early sunrises, late sunsets.","Does that signify less sleep, because we have a shorter amount of time for melatonin to be released?"],"376":["I learned about the two processes, process S and process C. I learned about the circadian rhythm, and it doesn't only rely on melatonin, but it also relies on your eating and a whole bunch of other factors that affect your circadian rhythm."],"377":["Mave."],"378":["So I'm at UC Berkeley, I'm a psychology student studying cognitive neuro-science and I just started my third year."],"379":["Thank you."],"380":["A lot of brain stuff."],"381":["I'm biased because I study one of the other sub-critical parts of the brain, the cerebellum."],"382":["Great."],"383":["In terms of the dopamine, if you're taking amphetamines, that's usually to promote, as you said, wakefulness, but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep?","How reliable are those kinds of interventions?"],"384":["Well in most studies, probably it is advised for your participants before they come in to get a good night's sleep, so those would be recommendations that you would lay out, you know, in communication with the participant, before they come in."],"385":["I often think that people, many people think that they can get by on very little sleep where the less than average amount of sleep, from what I know from the research, you know if you actually test those people on different batteries of cognitive tasks, you often find that their performance is slightly worse than they had anticipated."],"386":["I guess I learned a system that is, you know, very heavily regulated and influenced by some of these older conserved sub-cortical systems in the brain, and that there's, as you called it, like a flip flop function between wakefulness and sleep that's regulated by these specific dopaminergic, neurogenergic, like neurotransmitters, that manifest in different sub-cortical parts of the brain."],"387":["Yes, good to see you."],"388":["So I'm a epidemiologist, so we do a lot of work on the epidemiology of sleep and development of neurodegenerative diseases including both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, so ADMPD.","We mainly work on population studies.","We work on thousands and even millions of population, and we use statistical modeling to find out the association between different sleep disturbances and also genetics related to sleep disturbances and link that to their risk of developing ADMPD."],"389":["Our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations, for example, with sleep apnea.","We've done one meta-analysis and it's showed that those with sleep apnea, they have a ratio of 1.26, which means that those who have sleep apnea have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea."],"390":["Yeah, so I think what's really fascinating is all these bio-directional relationships that's being identified in animal studies especially, showing that sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process, so it could be a prodromal stage of Parkinson's, and also in transgenic model of AD, they're already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse."],"391":["Yes, in the transgenic mouse models of AD, including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein, APP type or both, so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in both of these pathologies."],"392":["So the thing I'm most excited about sleep research is, I think, first of all, this complexity of the daytime\/nighttime sleep, what sleep is really doing to our body and to our brain, and then is really from the epidemiologic or public health perspective, how we can best use sleep as a tool for the detection and prevention of neurodegeneration in the long-term."],"393":["Hi, I'm George Tulevski, and I'm a research scientist at IBM TJ Watson Research Center.","Today I've been challenged to teach one concept in five levels of increasing complexity.","And my topic is nanotechnology.","Nanotechnology is a study of objects in the nanoscale between 1 and 100 nanometers in size.","And it turns out that objects in this size scale have really interesting properties that differ from objects at a macroscopic scale.","Our task is nanotechnologists is to understand these materials, understand their properties, and then try to build new technologies based on these properties.","At the end of the day, my hope is that you'll understand nanotechnology at some level."],"394":["Hi, are you Bella?"],"395":["Bella, I'm George, nice to meet you."],"396":["I'm a research scientist.","Do you like science?"],"397":["I wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science called nanotechnology.","Have you ever heard of this word before?"],"398":["Nano is kind of a funny word, right?","It's a word that's used before another word, and it means one billion.","What's the smallest object you can think of?"],"399":["A baby ant?","Very good.","So I have over here a meter stick, let me show it to you.","And so that's a meter and if I divide it by 1000, I get a millimeter.","So milli just means 1000.","There's all these little lines on the ruler.","And each of those little lines is one millimeter.","So a baby ant is probably a couple of millimeters.","So even the thing, that's the smallest thing you can think of, it's a million times bigger than a nanometer.","Tiny, tiny, tiny."],"400":["If I took this stick and I was to draw 1 billion lines, the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer.","So that's really all it is.","It's just a measure of size.","But it's really, really, really tiny, smaller than anything that we can see with our eyes.","The reason why, in nanotechnology, scientists, we care about things that are that small, is because there are objects called atoms.","Have you ever heard of atoms before?"],"401":["That was a perfect explanation.","But what if I told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms, but also lets you move them around and build things with them.","Would you think that would be pretty cool?"],"402":["So it's called a scanning tunneling microscope.","And not only can you see the atoms, but you can move them around.","Atoms are kind of sticky.","You can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms.","So if I gave you that machine, would you want to make something?","Would you want to look at something very carefully?"],"403":["You are definitely a second grader!","[laughing] My daughter would probably answer the exact same way.","A unicorn would be awesome."],"404":["I study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties.","They behave completely different than objects that are big.","And because of that, we can build really cool things with them.","Like really fast computers, for example, or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells.","And a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with Legos.","You take these small objects and you put them together to build something new.","Something interesting that no one's built before.","It's like Legos for scientists."],"405":["So how old are you?"],"406":["16.","So what is that, you're in 10th grade?"],"407":["So 11th grade.","Have you of nanotechnology?","Have you heard of this term before?"],"408":["What do you think of when you think of nanotechnology?"],"409":["You know, you're right.","When you read about some of these technologies, it does feel like science fiction.","But the part of nanotechnology I wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day, most of your day, all of the time.","Can you guess what aspect of nanotechnology I'm gonna talk to you about?"],"410":["Yeah, so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology.","Does this look familiar to you?","Can you guess what this might be?"],"411":["So this is a silicon wafer, and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use, from a laptop, to a phone, to cars, television sets, appliances.","We ended up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns, each of those is a processor.","And those chips are what goes into all of these objects.","What I want to talk to you about is how we got from where we started, and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little one inch by one inch area.","They're called transistors.","It's a switch.","Very simply, think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage."],"412":["I went through my kid's Lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor.","And these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation.","You can do logic with them.","Where nanotechnology comes into play, the way you double the number of transistors on a chip.","Can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor?"],"413":["You have to make it smaller.","Exactly.","But here's the problem.","So about 10 to 15 years ago, the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate, that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel.","And so what they did, was they took devices like this into these things, we call them, FinFETs, kind of like a fin on a fish.","So they're very thin transistors.","The width of these fins is only six nanometers.","Okay?","So 6 nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across.","And they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly.","It's just a huge feat in engineering.","But these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have, or will have in the near future.","And it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now."],"414":["Exactly.","So these are made using a technique called lithography.","You basically coat the silicon wafer with a polymer.","Then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it.","And the features of the mask, the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip.","It's not just the size of the mask that matters.","It's the wavelength of the light that's used.","We talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before, but this is real stuff that's being produced, that's being made, that's being used every day by people."],"415":["Exactly.","I couldn't put it any better.","That's right."],"416":["So what's your major?"],"417":["What made you choose that?"],"418":["So have you taken a quantum mechanics course?"],"419":["I think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices, you really have to understand to some level, quantum mechanics.","What it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller, their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices.","There are materials, and you're taking a 2D materials class, you know about this, that are intrinsically thin.","As they're grown, as they're fabricated, they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist, you try to exploit.","And so the first ones I wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots, have you heard of quantum dots before?"],"420":["So these are typically semiconductors.","They can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide and they're small clusters of atoms.","They can be from 2 to 10 nanometers.","What's interesting about these materials?"],"421":["That's correct.","Yeah.","Because of quantum confinement, once you get below this 15 nanometer range, the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material.","So in bulk materials, if you want to change the band gap, you have to change the material, right?","But in these quantum dots specifically, just by changing the size, you can change their band gap.","And because their band gap is changing, their optical properties are different.","And you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size."],"422":["There are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers.","There are companies that are building displays from these materials.","And there're even people thinking about if I take these quantum dots, and I change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue, that I could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease, even maybe to treat disease, if you can very precisely control the chemistry."],"423":["The optical applications are in development.","The science has really been worked out.","The health stuff, because of all of the things you have to consider when you're putting something in someone's body is definitely further out there.","For example, some of them are made from cadmium.","Cadmium's toxic.","You would never put that in someone's body.","But there are other materials like gold and silver and titanium dioxide, which are less toxic and people are exploring using those.","So have you learned about graphene?"],"424":["Do you know what this is?"],"425":["Carbon nanotube, right.","So if you roll up graphene, depending on how you roll it and the angle, you roll it with, it has different properties.","So if I roll it one way, it'll act like a metal.","If I roll it a different way, it'll act like a semiconductor.","The one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through graphene.","And so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high-speed electronics.","The other interesting application is because it's one atom thin, it's very sensitive to changes in the environment.","And so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics.","It's on us researchers to find ways to A, control that process and then B, to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them."],"426":["You're speaking my language.","This is what I spent many years of my life working on.","You don't physically roll up graphene.","You grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface.","And then you do a CVD process, chemical vapor deposition.","So you basically flow in a carbon source, the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once nanocrystal is saturated, the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes.","Then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want.","So I have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that I want.","I modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another.","And then I just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to.","And it's still very much in the research stage.","The ultimate goal is to build functional high-speed electronics using these new materials."],"427":["Yeah.","100%.","That's right.","And that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials.","But I would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronic space.","Tens of thousands of scientists, every time they hit a barrier, at least historically, as a guide, they have found a way to overcome it.","It's a real marvel in ingenuity."],"428":["It's just pretty lights.","[laughing] But now that you suggested it, these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier.","So that's the story I'm going to stick with.","[laughing] I like it."],"429":["So you're a graduate student.","And so tell me a bit about your work."],"430":["What is it about nanomaterials, that scale and the properties of these materials that make them uniquely promising to incorporate into battery technology?"],"431":["What is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance?"],"432":["Because the materials are so small, they're at the nanoscale, their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics, which means that even slight changes in their size, in their orientation give profound changes in their properties.","And while that's very scientifically interesting, and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes, from a technology point of view, it's a bit of a headache in the sense that in technology want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again.","So what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and then trying to incorporate them into the batteries?"],"433":["That's actually, I think a very common problem.","We can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor, can be a battery.","And then you ask the question, okay, so what's the next step?","How do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology?","The kind of work that I'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want.","The tools that we've used in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up.","They're intrinsically small, and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them, to pull out the ones that you want.","You need to be able to build that same thing over and over again, with the exact same properties.","No one institution, no one research lab, no one national lab is gonna solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems.","And there is a real important payoff at the end.","And it's gonna take all of us, making our contributions to push this field forward."],"434":["I remember reading your papers when I was a student and we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their properties.","What I love, and I'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figured out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're doing now."],"435":["It's really fascinating work, especially now we're all familiar with the viruses and how they act.","And I'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures.","So how did you come to that?","And then how do you actually program a virus to do your bidding?"],"436":["So you've evolved, and I suppose, trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then evolving their function.","We're talking about the electronics from nanomaterials.","That critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with a single material, understanding its properties, how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology?","It is a chemistry driven approach.","We're not going to grow them exactly where we want them, but to take that one step, and to tie into what you're doing, tt sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using conventional chemistry, that we can train some of these biological elements to do that work work for us."],"437":["It's really fascinating.","You have all these little worker viruses building the materials for you.","How are you then applying these materials that you're building?"],"438":["Looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, where do you see your own work, and maybe the field more broadly?"],"439":["One of the things I love about about nanoscience is it tends to break up the silos between those traditional scientific disciplines.","My training was in chemistry, but I had to very quickly merged chemistry and physics.","And now I see an area where chemistry, physics, and biology are coming together to produce new materials and new technology, and to advance the field forward.","And so being in this field, you kind of have to cross pollinate between these different disciplines and kind of advance the field together."],"440":["So Angela, thank you so much for joining us.","And I look forward to seeing more work coming out of your lab in the future."],"441":["I really enjoy talking to these five different people about nanotechnology.","Nanotechnology is a field that affects all of us every day as finds its way into a variety of applications.","And I hope you enjoyed it as well and see the impact that nanotechnology has on your life today, and how much more of an impact it'll have on all of our lives in the future"],"442":["Yes."],"443":["Nice to meet you too!"],"444":["Yeah."],"445":["Nhn nhn."],"446":["A baby ant?"],"447":["Tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny."],"448":["Yes.","I first heard of them on a show I watched called StoryBots.","They're just little things that make up everything on Earth, even earth."],"449":["Yeah!"],"450":["I would want to make a unicorn out of atoms."],"451":["Why do you study stuff so small?"],"452":["Cool."],"453":["I'm 16."],"454":["Junior year."],"455":["Yeah, I've heard of it."],"456":["It kind of seems very science fiction."],"457":["My phone?"],"458":["I don't know."],"459":["OK."],"460":["You make it smaller?"],"461":["How do you make stuff that small?","Obviously it's not handmade, so is it factories and stuff?"],"462":["In middle school, I built all of the little switches where you turn the electricity on, and it goes from one thing to the other.","But those are the really big, comical, like plugging in Legos and stuff.","When we saw the picture of all of the little ones, it's like a city, it's crazy how simple and complex it is at the same time."],"463":["Chemical engineering."],"464":["Like any freshman, going into chemical engineering, I was like, I like chemistry!","So I'm gonna go into chemical engineering.","But luckily I also like all the math and all the science too."],"465":["I have.","I took that last year."],"466":["Yes."],"467":["Well, the other day we were talking about the different dimensions you can have of nanotechnology.","So all the way from like 0D to 3D.","If I remember correctly, my professor labeled it as 0D?"],"468":["What are the applications of these quantum dots?"],"469":["How far away is this from being actually used on an industrial level?"],"470":["Yeah."],"471":["Carbon nanotube?"],"472":["So you've been talking about the different ways you can say, roll these nanotubes.","So how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter?"],"473":["In my nanomaterials class, actually just a couple of days ago, we were talking about different applications of nanotechnology and things we know.","And we touched on the topic that right now, silicon is down to the smallest level that it can get.","And so we have scientists out there researching other materials, to replace silicon."],"474":["I gotta ask.","The lights that are behind you, is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all?"],"475":["Well, thank you so much.","This was all so very interesting."],"476":["I've been working on energy storage materials.","And the most popular are batteries that we work on.","A lot of the revolution that's come in electronics is kind of our model to try and use some nanoscale advances and put them into batteries."],"477":["So for batteries, one of the main constraints when we're designing batteries is trying to maintain or reduce the volume and mass of the components.","And nanomaterials are particularly well suited to adding functionality while having this negligible increase in volume.","So we get a huge benefit from using nano materials without sacrificing the volume of the battery."],"478":["At first, one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity.","And so carbon anodes and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries.","And then in the subsequent years, nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries, to increasing the functionality of batteries, having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix, and then you add a safety functionality to a battery.","We're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can.","And as new nano materials are being discovered and there're new properties being discovered, a lot of the time that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery."],"479":["I think every step of a process in a battery is something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production?","One thing that I think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general, is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot.","And so we claim that this 2D material has this property, then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do.","It takes a few steps in between.","So we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that."],"480":["Life gave us this toolkit that is already on the nanoscale.","So we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nano scale and manipulating materials on the nano scale, and wiring them together as well.","This abalone shell, you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it.","This is a nano composite material.","If you take this and fracture it, and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope, what you'll see is that it's made out of these beautiful tablets.","And I studied that as a graduate student.","I looked at that and I said, that is completely amazing.","You have an organism in the ocean, that takes what's in its environment, which is calcium and carbonate.","That's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure.","And so you think that's great.","Calcium carbonate is great, but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a battery, how would you get an organism to do that?","And you say, okay, that's a really crazy idea.","But is it really that crazy if this abalone, already figured out how to do it, 500 million years ago?","So we're saying, okay, abalones build shells.","Can viruses build solar cells, can viruses build catalysts?","Can they build batteries using the same kind of idea?"],"481":["We work on something called bacteriophages, it's a virus with DNA.","This particular bacteriophage called M13 bacteriophage is made up of single stranded DNA and proteins.","It's long and thin.","So it's 880 nanometers in length, and it's about 9 nanometers in diameter.","And so one of the reasons I love it is it spans the nanoscale and almost the micron scale at the same time.","Take the single strand DNAs, obviously a model, and you can cut it with molecular scissors.","And you can put a new piece of DNA in between.","And so you put a small piece of DNA in there that doesn't belong there.","And that piece of DNA is going to randomly code for a protein.","Now, the next time that that virus is replicated within a bacterial host, it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat, just a short protein sequence on the coat, maybe like 8 or 12 amino acids in length.","And just like that abalone is going to grab calcium and build calcium carbonate.","We're going to have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or Gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material."],"482":["Biology is chemistry.","Molecules, proteins, and DNA work with all the same kinds of bonding and things that the chemicals that you're gonna be looking for in these processes.","It's put together in a way that when a protein or enzyme folds, it almost always folds correctly.","That's kind of the beauty of it, the predictable aspect of it encoded in its DNA.","If we need to make it the same over and over again, then as long as you have the right DNA sequence, DNA is a beautiful structure on the nanoscale.","And there's really, really cool, incredible work on DNA origami, when DNA can fold into just the right structure.","And so I can see that as an interface, that would be really cool and interesting in your work.","And you can have the virus make the DNA for the DNA origami, and then you use DNA to assemble your beautiful structures."],"483":["We started thinking about how can we make an impact in cancer?","We do it mostly in imaging technology to look deep inside the body noninvasively with light.","And the way that we came about that was through solar cells and batteries.","We trained our viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and hold onto them very, very tightly.","And then we'll give a virus a second gene, decode for a protein, to grow, in a case of a battery, a battery electrode material.","It allows it to weave together a good electrical conductor and a good ionic conductor at the same time, all within this really, really small space.","And the optical properties of these carbon nanotubes are in the wavelength.","That is interesting for imaging deep inside the body.","We started building a bunch of imaging tools that could image above a thousand nanometers, a wave length.","And so this is in [audio distorting] and that's a really special window where you have some optical transparency of tissue in the body.","The other gene, we engineered to find ovarian cancer.","We developed imaging tools with Harvard Medical School and MIT Lincoln Labs to find tiny ovarian tumors.","It's hard to see things less than a centimeter in size with ovarian cancer, just based on the location in the body.","But with our imaging system, we could find tumors that were below a millimeter in size, actually."],"484":["The future I'd like to see is environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis.","And I think that we're really going that way.","If we think about batteries of the future, solar cells of the future, thinking about earth abundant materials and processes that are compatible with the earth and environment."],"485":["I agree completely.","We like to solve problems.","Nano bio is the toolkit that we bring a lot.","It happens to be a very strong and evolving toolkit.","That's another thing that I love about biology is if you can come up with a solution that's not perfect at all to begin with when you're making a battery electrode material or any kind of material you're making, you have evolution on your side to try to make it better and better as a function of time.","That can be quite rapid."],"486":["Thanks for having me, George, it was really fun to interact, and I'm very excited about our future collaborations.","Me too.","Absolutely."],"487":["Hi, I'm Janna Levin, I'm an astrophysicist, and I've been asked to explain gravity in five levels of increasing complexity.","Gravity seems so familiar and so everyday, and yet it's this incredibly esoteric abstract subject that has shaped the way we view the universe on the larger scales, has given us the strangest phenomena in the universe like black holes that has changed the way we look at the entirety of physics.","It's really been a revolution because of gravity."],"488":["Are you interested in science?"],"489":["Yes, you are?"],"490":["Do you know what gravity is?"],"491":["That's pretty good.","So gravity wants to attract us to the Earth, and the Earth to us.","But the Earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the Earth a little bit to us, you don't notice it so much.","You know, the Moon pulls on the Earth a little bit."],"492":["[Janna] Exactly, the Moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby that it has the larger effect, pulling the water of the Earth.","But more than the Moon, think about the Sun pulling on the Earth.","We orbit the whole Sun, just the way the Earth pulls on the Moon and causes the Moon to orbit us.","All of those things are acting on you and me right now."],"493":["That's such a good question.","No, we actually couldn't.","In the Moon, gravity is weaker, you can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the Moon.","On the Earth, it's harder, 'cause it's bigger.","If you go to a bigger, heavier planet, it gets harder and harder.","But there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms, no way we could step or walk.","The gravity is just way too strong.","Do you know how tall you are?"],"494":["Maybe four three.","People think that while you're sleeping, your body has a chance to stretch out and gravity isn't crunching you together, but when you're standing or walking or sitting, the gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly, so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller than in the evening.","See if it works for you.","[Woman] Wow."],"495":["Yes."],"496":["They say that astronauts in space, definitely their spine elongates.","There were two twin astronauts, one who stayed here on Earth and the other who went to the International Space Station.","He was there for a long time, and when he came back, he was actually taller than his twin brother."],"497":["Yeah, and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated.","After a while here on Earth though he'll readjust, he'll go back to the same size.","Have you ever heard of how gravity was discovered?"],"498":["Isaac Newton would ponder, how does the Earth cause things to fall?","There's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law, this mathematical law for how that works.","I don't actually think that's a true story, though."],"499":["But it's a good story.","So Isaac Newton realized that even if you're heavier, you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter, that that's the same.","Once you hit the ground, if you're heavier, you'll hit the ground with much greater force, but you will hit the ground at the same time."],"500":["Yep, so like a penny from the Empire State Building will fall at the same rate as a bowling ball."],"501":["Yeah, amazing.","Wanna try it?"],"502":["A light object, see how light that is."],"503":["Very light?"],"504":["And a heavy object."],"505":["They look the same, but this is much heavier, right?","Okay, so try it, just try holding your arms up front, a little higher maybe, give them a chance to drop, and then drop them.","[balls thud] [Janna laughs] Did they fall at the same time?","Did they hit at the same time?","So, Isaac Newton, he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth and the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and that's a huge leap.","Here he is, looking at just things around him, and then looks at the stars and has this really big realization, that that's actually the same force.","So, what have you learned today talking about gravity?"],"506":["Newton."],"507":["That's beautiful, I'm impressed."],"508":["So, Maria, you're in high school?"],"509":["[Janna] And are you studying any sciences in high school?"],"510":["Do you think of yourself as curious about science?"],"511":["What interests you?"],"512":["What's your impression of what gravity is?"],"513":["So you're saying gravity pulls things down, yet we've launched things into space.","Do you ever wonder how we do that?"],"514":["Well, that's true, we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system.","So, for instance, we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close, it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to speed up.","But mostly, around the Earth, gravity pulls things down, so when we want to send a rocket into space, when we wanna go to the Moon, when we wanna send supplies to the International Space Station, the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the Earth.","Have you heard the expression what goes up must come down?","It's actually not true.","If you throw it fast enough, you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again, and that's basically how rocket launches work.","You have to get the rocket for the Earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second.","Think of how fast it is.","Just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers.","If you get it to go that fast, it's not gonna come back down again.","So you know the International Space Station which is orbiting the Earth?","That's going around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour.","It has no engines anymore, the engines are turned off.","So it's just there falling forever.","So once it's out there, it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that."],"515":["In a weird way, that is gravity pulling it.","So have you ever had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this?","The string is pulling it in at all times, but you've also given it this angular momentum.","And as long as you give it the angular momentum, pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit.","And so the Earth is pulling it in at all times, so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line.","It keeps coming back around.","So it's funny, people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity, and that's not the case at all.","They're absolutely feeling gravity.","They're just cruising so fast that, even though they're being pulled in, they never get pulled to the surface."],"516":["Yeah, you feel pinned to that.","It's exactly like that.","There's something called the equivalence principle where people realized, especially Einstein, that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate, you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you were on a rocket ship that was accelerating."],"517":["Yeah.","You ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving?"],"518":["That's because in some sense, you're really not.","Imagine you're in this train and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform, but it's so smooth, then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion, there's no absolute motion.","So that if you throw a ball up, you might think from the outside of the platform, be confused that when gravity pulls that back down, it's gonna hit you or something, but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room."],"519":["So imagine you were an astronaut and you were floating in empty space.","You can't see anything.","There's no stars, there's no Earth.","You can ask yourself, am I moving?","There's really no way for you to tell.","So you would probably conclude, well, I'm not moving.","So then your friend Marina comes cruising past you, and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second, and you say, Marina, you're cruising at thousands of kilometers a second, you're going so fast.","But she had just done the same experiment.","She was just floating in space thinking, Am I moving?","There's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion.","The only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion, that's true.","You both agree you're in relative motion, and that's clear.","But neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary."],"520":["So let me tell you where it gets really crazy."],"521":["So, let's say you and Marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving.","Let's say you both see a flash of light.","A flash of light comes from somewhere, you don't know where.","So you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second.","But here comes Marina and she's racing at the light pulse, as far as you can tell.","Two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars, right?"],"522":["So you would say, oh Marina is gonna measure a different speed of light.","But she comes back and she says, No.","300,000 kilometers per second.","Because from her perspective, she's standing still, and the laws of physics have better be the same for her.","The speed of light is a fact of nature that's as true as the strength of gravity.","And the two of you are in this quandary because if one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light, that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion.","Which one of you should it be?","So Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of life.","How could that possibly, possibly be the case?","And he thinks, well, if speed is how far you travel, your spatial distance, in a certain amount of time, then there must be something wrong with space and time.","And he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for Marina.","And that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time.","[laughs] You have the best expression on your face.","[laughs] It's pretty wild, but that is a starting point, actually, of the whole theory of relativity.","That starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang and black holes and space-time.","Just from that one simple starting point.","So, is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation?"],"523":["And it's a really deep principle.","And what about the theory of gravity?"],"524":["It's like a big paradigm."],"525":["So, you're in college?"],"526":["[Janna] And what are you studying in college?"],"527":["So, from your perspective, how would you describe gravity?"],"528":["So, when you say it's an inverse-square law, that means that the closer you are, the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull.","And that makes sense.","There's very few things that are stronger when you're further apart."],"529":["So you can also think of a gravitational field, something that permeates all of space.","Even though the earth is three stories below us, it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance.","We're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point.","And that's nice, because people were worried that if things acted at a distance, that the way that old-fashioned inverse-square force law describes it, that it was as spooky as mind-bending a spoon, that it was like telekinesis.","If you don't touch something, how do you affect it?","And so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of a space.","And it's weaker very far from the Earth and it's closer very close to the Earth.","So one way to think of this field as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere.","Forget the difficulty of the math, just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations.","One was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life.","So, right now, you might feel heavy in your chair, and we might feel heavy on the floor and our feet, or standing in an elevator cab.","And Einstein said, what does the chair have to do with it, or the floor, or the elevator?","Those aren't gravitational objects.","So he wanted to eliminate them, and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can see out of, a black box.","And imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall."],"530":["You're in total free fall.","Now, because things fall at the same rate, including the elevator and you, you can actually float in the elevator.","If you just floated in the elevator, the two of you would drop, and you might not even know you're falling.","You could take an apple and drop it in front of you, and it would float in front of you.","You would actually experience weightlessness.","It's called the equivalence principle.","It was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair, it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field.","And that was the first step, to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling."],"531":["Yeah, exactly."],"532":["You can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling, the plane just drops out of the air.","And while it's falling, they will float weightlessly, and there's been a lot of experiments about it, but you don't want it to end unhappily, so the plane has to scoop back up, and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the plane, because then the plane is interrupting their fall.","So that's the first thought, and then the next is, what is the shape that's chased?","So if you were floating in empty space, really empty space, and you had an apple, and you threw the apple, what shape do you think it would chase, the path?"],"533":["Yeah, it would just go straight.","But if you did that on the Earth, what would happen?"],"534":["Yeah, it would chase a curve, it would chase an arc.","And the faster you throw it, the kind of longer the arc.","So the second step to think about curved space-time is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the Earth, they trace curved paths, as though space-time itself, space itself was curved."],"535":["You had that moment, I saw that it your face!"],"536":["You went, Oh.","[Janna and Lisa laugh] So, that's the intuition, that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that, well, there's this field that permeates all of space, and what is really describing is the curves that things fall along.","And from there, it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description, that's really hard.","But that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments."],"537":["Isn't it kind of amazing?"],"538":["So you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity where Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time.","And it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity, but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity.","So suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow.","Some evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun.","In Newton's understanding of gravity, we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the Earth.","And that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.","No information, not even information about the Sun, could possibly travel faster than the speed of light.","So we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes, which is the time it would take light to travel to us.","And so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity, but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity.","So then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the Earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves, well, then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate, that they can really warp, that they can bend and that they can curve.","And then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow, the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually begin to ripple, and those are the gravitational waves, and they would change and they would flatten out, 'cause the Sun was no longer there.","And that would take the light-travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone, and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line."],"539":["Wow.","[Janna and Lisa laughs] Well, let's hope it doesn't happen."],"540":["So what do you think you walk away with?","What do you think you learned?"],"541":["Yeah, it does for me too, so thank you.","[laughs]"],"542":["So you're getting your PhD in physics?"],"543":["So what would that have to do with gravity or astrophysics?"],"544":["So what I love about neutron stars personally is that they're kind of city-sized, right?"],"545":["[Janna] They're about the size of a city.","So you're imagining something more than the mass of the Sun."],"546":["Now, that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong around the neutron star.","So what would happen if we were on a neutron star, because of the gravity?"],"547":["So what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes?"],"548":["Black holes are so amazing that when the neutron star stops and there's something actually there.","There's material there.","If it's so heavy it becomes a black hole, so it keeps falling, once the event horizon of the black hole forms, which is the shadow, the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape, the material keeps falling.","And like you said, maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there, but whatever happens, the star's gone, that black hole is empty.","So in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing."],"549":["There isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet, and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down, and we need to take the extra step of going to some kind of quantum theory of gravity.","And we don't have that yet.","So even though the black hole isn't completely understood, we do know that they form astronomically, that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form.","The consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time.","So, for instance, if two black holes orbit each other, they're like mallets on a drum, and they actually cause space-time to ring, and it's very much part of gravitation.","The ringing of space-time itself, we call gravitational waves.","And this was something Einstein thought about right away in 1950-1960, he was thinking about that."],"550":["[Janna] Yes, they ring space-time also like a drum, and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years, when it's traveled through the universe.","But then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide, and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter, which you study, it becomes this firework of different explosions.","It's really quite spectacular."],"551":["Yeah, it was, to my knowledge, the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity."],"552":["So when the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized, oh this sounds like, you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound, these sounds like neutron stars colliding, not black holes.","And so, like you said, there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from.","So, from your point of view, they're like two super-conducting giant magnets colliding, an experiment you could never do on Earth.","That's just the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter."],"553":["[Janna] The way you do in a bomb.","It's basically nuclear fusion."],"554":["Yeah, it's amazing.","It's literally populating the periodic table."],"555":["So you are already a PhD student, you know a lot about gravity, but what do you think you've taken away from this conversation?"],"556":["See, you're a scientist.","[laughs] Isn't the best part being able to ask the questions?"],"557":["So we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies, the Earth, the Moon, pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force, to the Earth creating curves in space-time, then we moved on to just diffused seas of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general, and here we are, and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics.","Where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point?"],"558":["So when we think about quantum mechanics, we think about particles and their quantum charges in the Feynman way, the way that Feynman taught us.","They come in and they exchange a force carrier and then they come out again, so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering, for instance, or something like that.","And the language that Einstein gave us is so different.","It's completely geometric, it's all this space-time.","And it's also unnecessary."],"559":["Is there really space-time or are we just using unnecessary language because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful?"],"560":["To have the waves together."],"561":["So do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes, individual space-time, so we should be thinking about superpositions of space-times?"],"562":["So when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang, we are really talking about gravity ultimately, and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we know think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation, has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things, and we don't have that yet.","One of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few.","It's the Big Bang, because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action.","And there's black holes.","One of the most interesting discoveries is of course Hawking's discovery, kick-started a kind of crisis, right?","In thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads.","It was one of the most beautiful examples."],"563":["This is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in reality.","You can't precisely say where the electron is, and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving."],"564":["Right."],"565":["This idea that the darkest phenomenon in the universe actually is forced to radiate quantum particles is pretty wild.","I think everyone understood that it was a correct calculation, but I don't think a lot of people understood the implications, that it meant something really terrible was happening.","Because this black hole, which could have been made of who knows what, is disappearing into these quantum particles which, in some sense, have nothing to do with the material that went in.","So do you think that's a big crisis?","The black hole evaporates, the information is lost?"],"566":["Practical purposes."],"567":["So this is a huge crisis 'cause either quantum mechanics is wrong, and as you described it, it's the most accurately-tested paradigm in the history of physics, how could it be wrong, right?","Or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity."],"568":["That's a nice way of looking at it.","So that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wave function has really peaked around a very well-defined stage."],"569":["Yes, so one of the things I like to think of with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information in a black hole.","I mean, you can literally think of it as throwing things into it.","So let's say I have information in some volume and I'm under the illusion that I can just keep packing information in that volume, as much as the volume will contain.","Eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out that the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area.","And since area is projecting the illusion, maybe, of volume, maybe the whole world is just a hologram.","It's not a principle that only applies to black holes.","It's saying that, if this theory of quantum gravity is correct, then this while three-dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional.","That's crazy."],"570":["[Janna laughs]"],"571":["A smaller and smaller space, trying to pack it denser and denser, until eventually we make a black hole."],"572":["Right, exactly.","And the most knowledge you could ever have would only be on a two-dimensional surface."],"573":["Do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far, like the Newtonian way and the space-time way, that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions?","Sometimes I talk about it in terms of temperature.","Temperature is not a thing.","There is no single thing called temperature.","It's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior, really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms.","And is it possible that the whole of gravity is some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomenon underlying it?"],"574":["I mean, temperature is still great to talk about.","It doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature.","I mean, we should absolutely adjust our thermostats and talk about temperature.","But if we look at it closer and closer and closer, we realize there's not a thing in the world that has as a quantum value temperature, isolated.","And so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics."],"575":["So that's just like saying there's the idea of a dual description.","It's just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions, and so to belabor which one's real is silly.","It's like saying, is French or is English real?"],"576":["[Janna laughs]"],"577":["Yeah, you don't go to the doctor and say, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle caused a series of fluctuations."],"578":["Thanks so much for coming.","It's really good to have you here."],"579":["I hoped you learned something about gravity you hadn't thought of before, and I hope even more that it provoked some questions.","So thank you for watching."],"580":["Yes."],"581":["Yes."],"582":["It's something that, so, right now, we would be floating if there was no gravity, but since there's gravity we're sitting right down on these chairs."],"583":["Mm-hmm, just like the ocean tides."],"584":["If gravity was too strong, would we be able to get up?"],"585":["I'm in the fours.","In the fours?"],"586":["So that was last night?"],"587":["[Bonet screams] Ooh."],"588":["Wow."],"589":["Mm-hmm."],"590":["Yeah."],"591":["So, if we both dropped down from a plane, we would both land at the same time, but you would land heavier?"],"592":["Oh my God."],"593":["Yeah."],"594":["That's..."],"595":["Yeah."],"596":["Oh my God.","[Janna laughs]"],"597":["I've learned that the person that learned about the apple."],"598":["He was learning about gravity just about what he saw on this planet.","I also learned that if you drop one light thing and one heavy thing at the same height at the same time, they're both gonna drop at the same time but one's gonna drop a little heavier than the other."],"599":["Yeah, I'm a junior."],"600":["I'm taking physics right now."],"601":["Well, there are some things that interest me and others that bore me, so it depends."],"602":["Well, I'm a gymnast, so in physics they talk about force and stuff and then I think of how I use physics in my own life."],"603":["I think that if there's no gravity, everyone would float everywhere.","It pulls things down, and without it, everything would be chaos."],"604":["Isn't it like a slingshot, like if you pull something back enough it'll go in the opposite direction?"],"605":["And does the gravity pull it or is it just floating?"],"606":["It's like that ride at the rollercoasters where you go in and it's spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast but--"],"607":["That's crazy."],"608":["Yeah, 'cause I go on the train every day to go to school, but I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the train, and then I'm like, wait, what?"],"609":["Isn't that kinda crazy?","Amazing."],"610":["[laughs] I don't even know what to say to that."],"611":["[Maria laughs]"],"612":["Yeah."],"613":["Yeah, 'cause I knew that when I was on the train it didn't feel like I was moving, but I didn't know why or that it was a thing and I wasn't crazy.","[Janna and Maria laugh]"],"614":["I don't know, usually when I just heard gravity it's from my coaches, but I didn't know it was all these things."],"615":["Yeah."],"616":["I'm a physics major."],"617":["I'm taught that it's a force.","It's described by inverse law.","But I also know that it's a field.","And there's a recent discovery with gravitational waves, although I don't know the specific details about that."],"618":["Yeah."],"619":["So, in free fall?"],"620":["I know zero-gravity experiences that are done with planes, I believe?"],"621":["Yeah, yeah."],"622":["Well, if I threw it straight, I would think it would go straight."],"623":["It would just go down."],"624":["Oh."],"625":["Yeah, yeah, yeah."],"626":["That's amazing."],"627":["Yeah.","[laughs]"],"628":["Wow."],"629":["Yeah.","[Janna laughs]"],"630":["Well, I learned more about the intuitions behind the concept.","'Cause we already just do the problems but sometimes you get lost in the math, but speaking like this it really helps build my intuition."],"631":["That's right.","Theoretical high energy physics.","Basically the physics of really, really small fundamental things."],"632":["Well, what I'm looking at is states of matter that might exist inside neutron stars.","So, when a star dies, if the star is massive enough, there's a huge explosion, called a supernova, and the stuff that's left behind that doesn't get blown away collapses into a tiny compact blob called a neutron star."],"633":["That's right."],"634":["[Will] Yeah, or about the mass of the Sun, condensed to the size of a city.","It's dense enough that one teaspoon-full would weigh about a billion tons here on Earth."],"635":["We would immediately be crushed into the ground, I think our bodies would be shred into their subatomic particles."],"636":["So, as I understand it, a black hole is sort of like a neutron star's big brother.","It's more intense, though.","If you have so much matter when a star is collapsing that it can't hold itself up, it collapses to a black hole, and those are so dense that space-time breaks down in some way or another."],"637":["So is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole, or is that, should you think of it as there is no space-time inside?"],"638":["Those waves are very exciting for me too because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves and we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal."],"639":["That's right, in fact, when we recorded that for the first time with gravitational waves, we then pointed telescopes at it and were able to see it optically as well, and that gave scientists a lot of data."],"640":["Wow, that's amazing."],"641":["Absolutely.","I've heard statistics like many Earth masses worth of gold were created, forged in the neutron star collision that caused that.","We used to think that most elements in the universe were created in supernova, which is when stars explode, because there's so much violent activity at the center that you need that kind of energy to create new elements."],"642":["Sure, but we now think that that kind of fusion happens when two neutron stars collide.","If you think about it, you have two massive blobs of neutrons.","When you smush them together, you've got neutrons colliding.","It creates the conditions where new elements can be created."],"643":["Yes, we now think that most of the heavy elements after some number are created in neutron star collisions."],"644":["Well, I've definitely taken away that the way that we think about gravity today is very different from how Newton thought about it, and that even though we have a very good understanding, there's lots of things that we don't fully understand.","There's still a lot of questions to be answered, which I think is really exciting."],"645":["Oh yeah."],"646":["Well, one thing is quantum mechanics.","Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory in the history of science, it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely.","Yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it."],"647":["Yeah, for me, the beauty of the theory of gravity is the way Einstein formulated it, as a theory of geometry, of curved space and time.","I think, like you, that's one of the things that really pulled me into it."],"648":["Well, I think there's really space-time in the sense that it's a description that works really well, so there has to be something right about it.","I mean, if we're gonna talk about what's really, really underlying that and we're gonna put quantum mechanics into the mix, then there should be some quantum mechanical wave function for space-time.","You should be able to take two different space-times and add them together, 'cause one of the crazy things about quantum mechanics, as you know, it's--"],"649":["Yeah, and in two states and in two possible states of the world, you can just literally put a plus sign between them and that's a sensible state, that's a good state, it makes sense."],"650":["Yeah, I think so.","I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe, back to when it was very, very dense, very small, and when quantum mechanics was certainly important, then it must have been like that.","I mean, if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology, something had to produce the density perturbations, the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and everything else in the world.","So there's a galaxy over there, let's say, and not over there, so how did that happen?","Why is there a galaxy there and not there?","In the standard theory, as you know, that was a quantum event, a random event.","And it doesn't mean that if happened there and not there 'cause you flipped a coin, it actually happened in both places.","There's gotta be a wave function where in one branch of the wave function there's a galaxy there and not there, and on the other branch it's the opposite."],"651":["Sure, yeah, it is a beautiful, beautiful idea.","So, first of all, to be totally clear, though, we've never observed Hawking radiation, which is what he predicted, directly.","I don't think very many people doubt that it's there, but yeah, Hawking discovered mathematically that when you have a black hole, it's got an event horizon, it's got a surface which is a point of no return.","If you fall through that surface, no matter what you have, no matter how powerful the rocket you've got, even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fall from, nothing escapes, not even light.","It all gets sucked in and spaghettified and destroyed at the singularity, or something, something happens, but it doesn't get out.","But in quantum mechanics, you can't really pin down the location of something precisely.","If you try to pin down an electron in a tiny circuit in a microchip, sometimes you discover it's not actually there and then your computer crashes."],"652":["Exactly, yeah, so when you get the blue screen of death, that might be because of quantum mechanics."],"653":["You know, you try to pin something down near a black hole, well, it's a surface, it's got a particular radius for a round black hole, and wanna say something is inside or outside, well, you can't absolutely say that in quantum mechanics.","And this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation, which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole.","The black hole is formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that.","If you think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being admitted.","And what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum, it looks like a hot, or not so hot for a large black hole, but like an oven, the kind of radiation that comes out of a cast iron."],"654":["It's a crisis because of some of the details of it, but I would say the way you just described, I mean, if I build a big bonfire or an incinerator and I throw an encyclopedia into it, good luck reconstructing what was in that encyclopedia.","The information is lost for all practical purpose."],"655":["Yes."],"656":["One thing about quantum mechanics is that any time you have a state of the world and another state of the world, you can literally add them together and get a third possible state, as crazy as that sounds.","And so if you're gonna have a quantum theory of gravity, then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole, or an event horizon or not an event horizon, because we could always a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't, or has the event horizon in a slightly different position, maybe, and add them together.","So the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be determined as a fact any more than the position of an electron is determined.","So I think that's the loophole."],"657":["That's right, and one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography, and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface that creates a three-dimensional image.","It's got sort of 3D information built into it.","And this, in a fundamental way, really has that 3D or higher dimensional information built into it.","It's exactly the same as this theory of gravity and more dimensions."],"658":["That's true."],"659":["And as practically speaking, you mentioned before in our conversation that it's really interesting that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a practical limit now in microchips.","If we make microchips much smaller than they already are, even as they already are, it causes errors, 'cause you don't know that the electron's in.","If holography, if this limit on how much information you can ever pack, if that ever become a limit, as far as we know that's an absolute limit.","We started off with clay tablets, not so much information per cubit centimeter or whatever.","Then we had written stuff that's getting better, encyclopedias with thin paper that's even better, CDs."],"660":["Yeah, at some point you try to fill up your encyclopedia with knowledge and you get swallowed up by a black hole."],"661":["Right, and as big as the universe, and then you're done.","So, you know, not likely that we're ever gonna hit that limit any time soon."],"662":["If we buy the idea of holography, then absolutely, that's for sure, that's what it's telling us.","Although which side is the illusion and which side is the reality?","They're the same."],"663":["Right, so I guess with the holographic description we've got two sides, which are actually secretly the same.","On one side there's definitely no gravity.","On the other side, well, it's a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that means.","But the point is you can get it out, it's equivalent to this theory."],"664":["Yeah, an example I like to give is if you take some extra dimensions and you compactify them, let's say just one, all that is, it's exactly prevalent to whatever particles you had, whatever fields you had in your original theory before you added it, you just added an infinite tower of new particles with certain properties that are all easy to calculate.","For me, it's a question of which description is most useful.","I mean, if you wanna say gravity is an illusion and it's all quantum, that's great, but then you fall down the stairs and bang your head."],"665":["It's sort of like there's a description that works pretty well."],"666":["Right, would you help me?","So there's so many open questions.","The fact that they are all these fundamental issues that we really don't understand.","But, on the other hand, there's all these moving parts that fit together so neatly.","There's definitely something that's working here.","But ultimately what is gonna emerge from that, what structure is lying under it, we just don't know.","But I think the fact that there are so many fundamental questions that we just don't know the answer to, that is an opportunity, that's exciting, it's great."],"667":["Thank you very much, Janna, it was my pleasure."],"668":["H\u00ee, I'm John Carmack.","I'm the chief technology officer for Oculus.","I work on virtual reality.","I've been challenged today to talk about one concept at five levels of increasing complexity.","So we're going to be talking about reality and virtual reality, what the technology allows us to do today, what it may allow us to do in future, and whether that should even be our goal to approximate reality."],"669":["So do you know what virtual reality is?"],"670":["That's actually a really good description.","The idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see, then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else, like on top of a mountain, or in a dungeon or under the ocean."],"671":["Yeah, or in Minecraft.","When you look at a TV on the wall there showing like a picture of a mountain or something, how can you tell that its not just a window and there's something else behind it.","Because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this, its not really changing.","And its interesting, those are things we have to figure out We need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether its real or not.","Have you been to a 3-D movie where you put on the little glasses?"],"672":["So what they do, the trick for that is, if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it, you'll see its blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time.","And what those little glasses do, is they let one eye see one picture, and the other eye see a different picture.","So then your eyes can say, oh it looks like I'm seeing through the screen or something is floating out in front of it.","In the VR headsets, what we do is, there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half, so that it draws a different picture, completely different picture, for each eye.","And we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to.","And that's what can make things feel like they got this real depth to them, that its something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat TV screen."],"673":["Try look over there and concentrate on his face over there.","Can you see me waving my hand without turning your eyes?"],"674":["Alright, so, at some point, you can probably see it right now?","So without moving your eyes, this is kind of hard, tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?"],"675":["You can just barely tell.","And you can see that even, like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand, then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there.","And you can change between that, like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry.","Because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places.","So we're hoping in the future, that hardware can be like that.","Where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking.","And every time you look someplace else, it moves the detail over to there.","So we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now.","Figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem.","What we try to go about this, is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here.","We're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us.","But its going to be a long time before we get to where we can really fool people."],"676":["So do you have a basic sense of what latency is?"],"677":["Its basically a delay and it happens in all parts of the system: monitors can be a big one.","Like consumer televisions can often have 15 milliseconds or more of latency just in the TV part.","And then you've got the processing and the computer and all of these add up to the total latency."],"678":["Games that feel really good, they've got that sense of it happens instantly when you're doing something."],"679":["30 years ago, you had desktop PCs which were, you spent whatever on that, but there was always this idea well you could spend a million dollars and buy a super-computer and its gonna be a lot faster.","And that's not really true today.","For scalar processing, when you just do one thing after another, a high-end, overclocked, cool gaming PC is about the fastest thing in the world.","It is within a very small delta, yeah for some things you'll get some IBM power system that might be a little bit faster, but not a whole lot.","So if I'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster.","What do you do?","You can't just say make each thing faster.","As a developer you're making a trade-off, I can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun.","And more fun usually wins out for very good reasons.","So there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things.","But you can always just design a game that will just not work well.","(laughing) I mean in the old days, games had to be so precisely designed.","Nowadays you've got a ton more freedom.","You really can--"],"680":["Yeah, any crazy idea you had now you could probably make a pretty good video game out of it.","Which is a wonderful, wonderful thing."],"681":["But VR makes, you have to give up a little bit of that freedom, you have to not do so many crazy things, so you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be."],"682":["You know an interesting topic is: what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality?","Where I'm pretty pleased with what we have today.","What we can show people and say virtual reality, its cool.","People get an amazing response from it.","But we're still clearly a very, very long ways from reality."],"683":["Mostly in VR we talk about the display and optics, the visual side of things, but we should at least tick off the other senses.","And haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things.","You can move your hands around, you can do everything but its a disconnected experience because you know you don't have an actual solidity there.","And I am pessimistic about progress in haptics technology.","Almost all other areas I'm an optimist and I'm excited about what's coming up, but I don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world."],"684":["Yeah, that is one potential quality improvement that is still on the horizon is when we do spatialization, we use HRTF, the Head Relative Transfer Function, to make it sound like its in different places.","But usually we just use this one kind of generic, here's your average human, HRTF function.","Its possible, that of course, if you are right in the average then its perfect for you.","But there's always people off to the extremes, that it doesn't do a very good job at.","And there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect HRTF which can improve the audio experience a lot.","It all comes down to all these trade-offs."],"685":["There was a huge concern about that at Oculus.","And the term internally that went around was poisoning the well.","They were very, very concerned.","I mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear VR should even be done, because the worry was if we let a product go out, like gear VR that didn't have those things.","That if somebody saw it and it was bad, made them sick, made their eyes hurt, then they would be like I'm never going to try VR again.","I tried it that time and it was terrible.","And there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that.","And it turned out that yes, its obviously better to have all those things, but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it.","Its weird being at the beginning of a medium like this."],"686":["Mostly today, I've been talking a lot about what can we do, what's possible.","We think might be possible in the next couple of years.","But really at the professional level its more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing."],"687":["As an engineer of course, I love quantifiable things.","I like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon, here's my angular resolution that I'm improving.","I'm doing the color-space right.","But you can look not too far back where you say we have blu-ray DVDs at this amazing resolution, but more people want to watch Youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds.","Where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing.","And while we're certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or for different things.","I don't think that its necessary.","I've commented that I think usually my favorite titles on mobile that are fully synthetic are ones that don't even try, they just go and do light-mapped, black-shaded.","And I think its a lovely aesthetic.","I think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing.","While you get some other titles that, oh we're gonna be high-tech with our specular bump maps with roughness.","And you've got aliasing everywhere, and you can't hold frame rate and its all problematic.","While some of these that are clearly very synthetic worlds where its nothing but these cartoony flat-shaded things with lighting, but they look and they feel good.","And you can buy that you're in that place.","And you want to know what's around that monolith over there."],"688":["The end goal of reality, of course in computer graphics people chase photo-realistic form for a long time.","And basically, we've achieved it.","Photo-realism, if you're willing to throw enough discreet path traced rays at things, you can generate photo-realistic views.","And we understand the light really well.","Of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has, or more, to render the different things.","So its an understood problem and given infinite computing power we could be doing that in virtual reality.","However, a point that I've made to people in recent years is that, we are running out of More's Law.","Maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough in quantum structures or whatever--"],"689":["But if we just wind up following the path that we're on, we're gonna get double and quadruple, but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now.","We will run into atomic limits on our fabrication.","So given that, I'm trying to tell people that, start buying back into optimization, start buying back into thinking a bit more creatively.","Because you can't just wait, its not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to be advanced.","If we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter, cheaper, more comfortable."],"690":["You know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the computer and simulated reasonably.","But of course we've got, you know we still don't do people well simulated.","That's a hard problem, we've been beating our heads against it for a long time.","I do think we're making progress and I wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years, but maybe 20 years.","Because it is going to take a lot of AI.","Its going to take a lot of machine-learning, where its not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro-expressions that people do.","Its gonna be lets take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people realistic."],"691":["I'm still a believer that the magic's out there.","We haven't found it yet, so somebody's going to happen upon the formula.","I feel like I've felt little pockets of magic."],"692":["So VR right now is pretty amazing.","When you look at it its things that you haven't seen.","But we are just getting started.","The next five years both technologically and creatively are going to really take this medium someplace that you've never imagined."],"693":["Yes, its simple.","Its like a video game except it feels like you're in the video game."],"694":["Or in Minecraft."],"695":["Yeah."],"696":["No."],"697":["Uh, three?"],"698":["Yeah, so my understanding of what latency is, is its basically the time delay between the rendering at different points."],"699":["The latency is, in my opinion, the most important part of VR, because if you have that offset your body is no longer immersed and you getting that motion sickness which can pull a lot of people out of the experience."],"700":["It really is a testament to this kind of technology and how its developing and how over time its gonna just be, you're gonna be able to pack more pixel density in those displays and its gonna get a lot more immersive."],"701":["Just the hardware.","Old games were ran off of 8 bit and that's all the data you could have."],"702":["Yeah, a lot of freedom."],"703":["That's very interesting."],"704":["That kinds of notes back to Realism in our history and how Realism was a response to Romanticism.","And Realism was meant to capture the mundane, everyday lives of individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way.","And I think that that's really important for virtual reality.","I think its kind of rite-of-passage for any kind of our technology to go through."],"705":["So I've tried the demos, at VRLA there's one that has waves, like audio waves I believe, that come up and then you can put your hands through that and feel the waves whenever you're supposed to be feeling bubbles or any kind of force field or something.","And those are pretty interesting.","I've seen some pretty interesting things that you can do with audios, you can cut down a lot of the storage I guess and the power that you would need in order to power a huge scene, you can just mimic the sounds of those scenes actually being there and they're not actually.","For example, a professor at USC would have the sound of a train drive by without actually rendering the sound.","And you would feel like you're deeply immersed in this world without having to have such an expensive scene built around you.","So I think those are pretty significant."],"706":["You know, with display and with resolution, its one of those things where if people have one bad experience they kind of, oh well everything else.","Its really difficult to build trust again with people who haven't done VR before but its easy to break off that trust when they have a bad experience."],"707":["Right, I'm very excited to see how filmmakers tackle creating content and those things.","Especially if they're experienced with traditional medium."],"708":["That's one of the things we're trying to figure out, from an artist and storytelling perspective, what are the things that will make this meaningfully different from what we're used to, like a television on our wall.","And we've been finding a lot of things, aspects of virtual reality that very much do that in my opinion.","Things that allow you to feel presence, first and foremost, where you get lost, and you have to remind yourself, this isn't actually happening.","And things that ultimately allow you to embody other characters.","Things where you can actually change your own self-perception and play with neuro-plasticity and teach yourself things that are bizarre and unique."],"709":["We did a project called Life of Us, which was exactly that mindset.","We were let's embrace low-poly aesthetic and just simple vertex shading.","And we ended up realizing, you can embody these various creatures and transform yourself.","And when you do that with co-presence of another creature, another human, it makes for a totally magical journey.","You don't even think for a second, you actually dismiss the whole idea of photo-realism and embrace that reality for what it is.","I think it actually helps put you at ease a little bit."],"710":["Or bandwidth, or streaming."],"711":["And there's constantly novel UX innovations.","Like Google Earth, where the kind of elimination of your periphery as you zoom in and move.","And also, giving you the user action to decide where you're going and looking.","I'm constantly seeing people coming up with ways to break from the paradigms of actual reality and then introduce mechanisms that work very well."],"712":["Absolutely, there are these crucial thresholds where you pass a technological hurdle and all of a sudden that unlocks a whole world of creative potential.","But I think, to your point very much, we need to solve the actual human and social challenges and turn those into opportunities to figure out how this technology fits into our lives."],"713":["You can imagine the utility behind this for creating a world or you can imagine the power of a story that would be told to you in this context.","And a lot of it is just picking those, putting them together in a meaningful way and then crafting something that's really bigger and intentional.","But I've now been joining with real people in virtual reality.","I think we also have different levels of connection.","Like the audio side is leaps and bounds above in terms of the nuance and personality and humanity.","When I hear people laughing and joking and really enjoying something.","Soon we'll get into that.","We're in macro-gestureland, where I can wave and say thumbs-up.","But when we get into micro-gestures and actually getting a sense of facial reactions and other things I think then we'll have a really incredibly rewarding time, spending time with each other."],"714":["Hi, I'm Varoujan Gorjian, I'm a Research Astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.","I've been challenged today to talk about once concept at five different levels of increasing complexity.","Today we're going to be talking about black holes.","A basic definition of a black hole is that it's a lot of mass crammed into a very tiny volume, such that the escaped velocity is the speed of light."],"715":["So have you ever heard of something called a black hole?"],"716":["Well, it has to do with, a lot with gravity, do you know what gravity is?"],"717":["It's what keeps us on the earth."],"718":["The reason we're not just flying off the earth is because earth has gravity, so if we throw something up, it comes back down, so that's why when we're walking on the earth, we don't fly off the earth because the earth has gravity, and it keeps us down."],"719":["The main thing about black hole to remember is that it's just, like I said, how the earth holds you down, the black hole pulls you in, as well.","Now, try and take the ball from me, black hole--"],"720":["I'm holding it tight to show you then when you're trying to pull it, a black hole will really hold onto it with its gravity."],"721":["Yeah.","The main thing is that if something falls into a black hole, it can never get out, it's--"],"722":["Oh, if the earth rolls into it?"],"723":["It would be bad, we wouldn't be able to get out."],"724":["It's never, not likely to happen, no."],"725":["Well, yeah, definitely in movies, yeah."],"726":["Yeah, exactly."],"727":["The black hole will sort of stretch you out as you're falling in."],"728":["Yeah."],"729":["So what do you think about black holes?"],"730":["So tell me, what do you know about black holes?"],"731":["You got, pretty much, you got a very good idea about it.","Basically you have a star, at the core its generating energy, which is countering the pressure of all that mass trying, being pulled in by gravity.","Once it can't generate that energy anymore, the core collapses, once the core is collapsing, it keeps collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing, and that's the critical thing that makes a black hole.","You have enough mass in the volume, such that the escaped velocity becomes the speed of light, once light can't escape, hence the black part.","(laughs) But that's the thing, is that just because there's an intense amount of gravity very close to a black hole, things don't start behaving differently.","And my favorite analogy is a vacuum, everybody thinks, like, if you point a vacuum cleaner at something, it's just gonna suck everything in--"],"732":["Right, you will feel the gravitational pull, and it'll redirect you in some way, and if you're far enough way, it's just like you're very far away from the sun, or something else.","If you're close enough, it will divert your path more, if you're close enough still, then you will get what are called tidal forces, where the difference between, for example, if you're standing next to a black hole, the difference in gravity between your feet and your head actually becomes significant.","Next time you see a science fiction movie, if somebody says, Oh, my god, we've been caught in the gravitation field of a black hole, and we're gonna fall in, it's like, no, no, just, if you're far enough away, just thrust a little bit this way, and then you'll slingshot around the black hole."],"733":["I wouldn't call them educational, but the movie Interstellar actually had, as one of the people involved in both writing it, and as a science advisor, Dr. Kip Thorne, who's a Professor at Caltech, who was part of the team that detected gravitational waves, and just won a Nobel Prize for it.","So he made sure to try and get it as accurate as possible, so Interstellar, I think, is one of the best examples of getting black holes right."],"734":["It's, there're multiple theories, there's observational evidence, more than some other theories that are really feeding into this because now we have the instrumentation, both in X-rays and infrared, in particular, because we don't have a direct optical line of sight to the center of our galaxy because there's just a lot of dust in the way.","But the infrared can penetrate the dust, the X-rays can penetrate the dust, the radio can penetrate all of that dust, so by combining all of these different wavelengths, people are really coming to a point of okay, how is this happening, by looking at different wavelengths of light, we can get a better sense, but they're still working on the theory, it's not all done."],"735":["So far, what do you know about black holes?"],"736":["So we've been, we've had, now, effectively two different ways of getting more direct measurements, one is the LIGO, which is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, which is where, getting the ripples in space time, coming off of the merging of black holes.","The other one that you're mentioning is actually called the Event Horizon Telescope, where they're using radio waves to actually image the event horizon, that region where light cannot escape from the black hole at the center of our galaxy, which I know they're working on it right now.","It's an amazing thing, but that'll be the most direct imaging of a black hole.","LIGO is a direct detection of the consequence of the merging of black holes.","The critical part has been, like, for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, we've seen the stars orbiting it, and we've measured the mass, so that way, so if you look at a spinning black hole, it actually fundamentally alters the emission that's coming off the stuff that's falling into it.","These are discovered as what are called X-ray binaries, that is, you know, there's an X-ray member of the binary that is emitting in the X-rays, and it's really not very bright in the optical (mumbles) at all, so there's always, people are looking at these X-ray binaries."],"737":["For my studies, I actually, when I started at UCLA in graduate school, I worked with a professor named Matt Malkin who was, gotten a lot of data observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, so that was one of my very first projects to work on, so any, space-based observatories have been a really big advantage, and then I've moved on now to the Spitzer Space Telescope.","In addition to that, then there's other people who've used a lot of X-ray telescopes, NuSTAR, Chandra have used data from that.","It's been a combination of both ground-based observatories, as well as space-based ones, and going everywhere from X-ray observations, not done by me, but certainly ultraviolet, and then optical, and infrared, particularly, those are the ones that I've been most involved with."],"738":["What got you interested in studying black holes?"],"739":["Which is, by the way, what, when I was just starting out in graduate school, that was the hot new thing, so."],"740":["That was, it was like, oh, wow, this might be it, and then, but very early on, it was, as I just started my, it was basically my second year of graduate school, it was like, uh, this is not that simple."],"741":["You know, everybody's been just coming at it from different wavelengths at the optical infrared, and, but definitely the X-rays has been one of those things where it's like, oh, finally."],"742":["It does seem to be that it may not even, in parts, it may not be even connected to this tiny, little torus at all because part of the work that I did, and others have done, is that type twos preferentially live in different kinds of galaxies than type ones, which should not in any way have to do with something such a small scale.","They tend to be in smaller bulged, SB and SC type spiral galaxies.","So there's something also having to do with environment that gets you to be a type two, and you can still maybe, timing wise, but there's something else that's going on on a larger scale because the type of the AGN should not really correspond to the host galaxy, but it seems to.","And that was one of the things that we were finding out, and that was one of the early little ideas that the, individually, just as the torus model, the unified model, can't explain everything that we were observing at the time.","But it is one of those things that it's, they're super luminous, they're all over the place, and we don't have a really good picture of it, which makes it exciting to study."],"743":["Oh, that makes sense, but it's always so difficult to get that."],"744":["So fortunately there's, I'm also doing it from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope, so particularly in the infrared, and my main interest has been to try and study the environment around the super massive black holes, not as close as where the X-rays are coming from, but clearly there's something from the X-ray corona that illuminates the rest of the accretion disk, and the dust that's further out.","And so fundamentally, that's one of the key things that I'm trying to use, is trying to see how long, once you've got this sort of pulse that's generated close to the black hole, it propagates out, and so you can use optical wavelengths to see that the accretion disk lights up in the optical a little bit as it gets heated up from the X-ray, and then later on, the infrared dust, the dust absorbs it, and emits it in the infrared.","And so that, I love that, the ability to exchange time for resolution, because these structures are so far away that we're never gonna get a telescope big enough where that has the resolution to see the accretion disk, or the dust distribution around--"],"745":["Yeah, again, we don't know exactly where X, Y, Z, zero is, we're assuming that it's something, you know, the X-rays that are coming out are very close to the event horizon of the black hole, but this is still, you know, your realm of X-rays, to really figure out those kinds of things.","But once the X-rays, once the photons hit the corona, and are re-scattered, and up, energized, and then they start illuminating the accretion disk, it heats it up, and so just by the light travel time, when the optical, if it gets, you know, brighter and fainter, and then the infrared gets brighter and fainter, two weeks later, then the dust is two light weeks away from that.","So it's a one dimensional one, so we're averaging, so we don't get the two dimensional, or even three dimensional one.","And then we've done it now, of course, we have better telescopes, there was a project where you could do it with the Hubble Space Telescope and the ultraviolet, you used the Swift Observatory, which had optical and ultraviolet, and then from ground base, we did optical, and then from space we did it with Spitzer and the infrared.","So you could actually see this bright flash go off in a nearby AGN called NGC5548, and then you see it propagate as it warms up the disk, as all that light is falling onto it, and then eventually you hit the, the, further away, where the dust is, and the dust tends to radiate in an infrared.","So we got basically a structure, and you just, you see this flashbulb go off, and then it illuminates, effectively, the structure."],"746":["So you do see it, basically the dust sublimation radius, and you see it at, and it tells you, depending on what kind of dust it is, and it's actually one of the problems for me studying, whenever we try and do X-ray studies of low luminosity active galactic nuclei in your, by galaxies, because there're all these X-ray binaries that are also emitting X-rays, which make our lives difficult.","But they're also in black holes, when it's this really interesting sort of both, it's great, but ugh, it's also a source of noise for those of us who are trying to do X-ray observations of nearby galaxies."],"747":["It's a weird thing to be sitting in your own galaxy, but not be able to separate all these, four million solar mass black hole creating, next to, how massive, it's like two to three solar masses for the X-ray binaries?"],"748":["Which is great, although it still doesn't help us in the AGN community, because we don't know how the millions to billions solar mass black holes came to be.","But it's, at least we're building up, or hopefully that at some point, and by understanding these lower mass, how these lower mass black holes came to be, then we can see where there are a large scale number of mergers can potentially give us this, or you really need something, other, another corridor to fundamentally get us something that's a million solar masses, you know, on the minimum side, but definitely, you know, we've gotten those which are billion.","So we know we can merge the million solar mass black holes to get the bigger ones, but how do you get to those in the beginning, particularly so early in the universe, when you get quasars at really high red shifts, so they're really early on."],"749":["And this goes to the idea that you don't have a core balance, that a supernova with a black hole as its final result, actually never has any kind of expulsion, that it all just goes.","(imitates sucking)"],"750":["Which was one idea, but again, it's, I'll leave this to your theoreticians, I think there are problems with that, as well.","I call it job security.","That's right.","(both laugh) We have a lot of things about black holes, both in terms of their formation, or even how they exist as they are, and how they're interacting with their environment that we're still not understanding."],"751":["What is a black hole?"],"752":["No, not at all."],"753":["What?"],"754":["Nice."],"755":["Why do you hold it so tight?"],"756":["I got it."],"757":["What about the earth?","What if it rolls into it--"],"758":["Yeah."],"759":["So it could never happen?"],"760":["Only in movies, right?"],"761":["Yeah, but it's not real because it's just pictures of it."],"762":["What if I went in there?"],"763":["It'll, like, stretch my body out?"],"764":["What?"],"765":["It's kind of dangerous."],"766":["Well, I know they're created when stars, once they start growing, it doesn't, it can't expand anymore, so they collapse inward."],"767":["But no, the wind, the pull isn't, if you're not close enough, it doesn't work."],"768":["So are there any movies that actually do, like, get space right?"],"769":["So it's, I'm assuming it's hard to, like, detect a black hole, besides if it's, if things are close enough that they're being pulled in, so it's basically a theory?"],"770":["I never knew beforehand how hard it was to get actual data of the black holes itself, first of all, they're dark, and, like, they're so far away, it's almost impossible just to get a good image of them.","They were discussing a project in which multiple radio telescopes of some sort, like, are, like, pinpointed all across, from Greenland to South America, and, like, and they're trying to get an image of the black hole in the center of our galaxy because, as opposed to just recording its impact on the surrounding stars and planets."],"771":["What sort of technology and, like, I guess tools have you been using in your studies, or, like, just in general, in the study of black holes?"],"772":["The way I got really interested in this field is I actually first came to Caltech as a summer student, and I started working in this research group called the NuSTAR Group.","Right now I'm doing my PhD in the field of active galactic nuclei, which are the most luminous compact objects in the universe, and it's because of the extreme accretion that we're seeing onto these super massive black holes.","We don't have such a simple picture, that this central black hole is surrounded by this donut shaped torus of material, and that all these different classes of AGN simply arise from a viewing angle effect of this torus, as a very oversimplified geometry, and this--"],"773":["Exactly."],"774":["It isn't."],"775":["And we've come a long way by seeing a wider range of the spectrum, we can elucidate more about the circumnuclear geometry, and there's just been so much progress made with all these new spectral models that we use to fit AGN spectra, and the different types of classes of AGN, like type one and type two are believed to be just a viewing angle effect of seeing this torus at different angles."],"776":["Yeah, and I think, you know, pushing towards the future, that, like, this whole multi-messenger era, and like, you know, utilizing all the different wavelength telescopes that we can is really the way to go.","We cannot just build up a picture purely from X-rays alone, or purely from infrared, and, you know, I think there should be increased effort to try and have more coordinated observations with the different telescopes, like NuSTAR--"],"777":["It is, and it's difficult to even just coordinate, you know, soft X-ray and hard X-ray telescopes together, like, getting, you know, time for both simultaneous, you know, say, Chandra observations, and NuSTAR observations, or (mumbles) and NuSTAR.","It's a difficult thing, but, you know, I think we really need to get a clear picture, to be looking at wavelengths, of course."],"778":["So how do you do your observations in optical and infrared?"],"779":["So do you get dimensions of the disk out of that?"],"780":["So you can map out the dust, where do you see it?"],"781":["We have the same problem, we can't see the actual black hole underneath all these very bright X-ray binaries."],"782":["The X-ray binaries, yeah, so they're, no, they're typically like 10 solar masses, so from three, you know, that's the smallest one you can have is from three solar masses, and then all the way up.","So that's where we have LIGO, and LIGO has now directly, I mean, this was all theory before, that we knew that this was gonna happen, and never seen it before, so LIGO is now the first time that we have been able to completely verify this theory, that you can have black holes and neutron stars merging together.","And so what happens in the case of two neutron stars, when they merge together, now suddenly they become heavier, they become heavy enough to turn into a black hole.","And so the first of these events happened in August, and what happened here is you had these two neutron stars that spun around each other, and then they merged, and then for a very short time, we are talking about 100 milliseconds, or tens of 100 milliseconds, it actually remained a neutron star, probably, it was a hyper massive neutron star because it was spinning so fast, it didn't collapse under its own weight.","But then, you know, the angular momentum gets dissipated away from the object, and then, at that point, it can't maintain its own weight, and then it collapses, and turn into a black hole.","All this theory that we knew about is now finally being, being validated."],"783":["Yeah, it is odd, it is very odd.","I mean, the other thing that's a little odd, now we're going back to stellar mass black holes is, so we look at a lot of supernova remnants, and we, so we see them, we can only really see them in our own galaxy, and so we have a lot of supernova remnants, and so how we see them is, you see the expelled mass from the star as it died, so that creates an extended source, and then you look for the compact object that was left behind.","And what's interesting is that you see, you quite often see the neutron stars because they pulse, so they're easy to see, but so far, we've not found a single black hole at the center of a supernova remnant.","And so, which is interesting, so you say, you should see them, you know, you ought to see some fallback, you know, you need some matter, you need something, but no, never, not yet been detected."],"784":["Yeah, that might be, yeah."],"785":["I'm Donna Strickland.","I'm a professor at the University of Waterloo.","I study lasers and, in particular, I like really high intensity lasers.","So a laser is a way to get light to actually just be a single color, going in a single direction all of the waves peaking at the same time so that the intensity can get very high.","Today I've been challenged to explain lasers and high intensity lasers at five different levels.","From a child, to a teenager, to a college student, to a graduate student and finally to a colleague of mine."],"786":["So I was told that maybe science is one of your favorite subjects at school.","Is that right?"],"787":["Have you actually studied light yet?"],"788":["Okay what have you learned so far about light?"],"789":["Oh really?","Oh excellent.","Well I'm somebody who studies lasers.","So what do you think about lasers?"],"790":["You haven't got to play with lasers.","So I brought one.","It's my friend's cat toy.","Do you ever use a laser as a cat toy?"],"791":["Well one of the fun things people do with lasers, the cat will try to grab that dot.","I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight.","I brought a cute little one.","So the question is, do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does?"],"792":["That's true, that laser's just a dot.","And so the other thing to notice though is that, like if I shine it in your eyes and I'm sorry if I do!","But it seems awfully bright doesn't it?","And yet when, you know, you shine this down and you put the laser, which one do you see easier?"],"793":["The laser.","So which one do you think's more powerful?"],"794":["[Donna] And yet it's not.","Isn't that amazing?"],"795":["One of the things that lasers are great for is that because it's a directed beam, we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes you maybe just want to see something around the corner and you can't see it.","But with a laser, you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go.","You see it actually bending the corner?"],"796":["And that's because the light will go through this glass and, when it hits that corner, it has to bend.","And we actually send laser beams down glass fibers, the size of your hair."],"797":["So this obviously is much bigger than our hair.","Right?"],"798":["So this is just a demonstration.","If you have a laser like this, it actually bends and comes out, I'm gonna point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end.","It hits these walls, it has to go around and come out the other side.","You wanna play?","So is this the first time you've seen a laser or have you gotten to play with lasers somewhere else?"],"799":["You don't have a cat.","So you don't need a cat toy no.","Have you ever gone to a grocery store and just scanned your objects over?"],"800":["Have you ever seen that maybe there's a little bit of a red light when you do that?"],"801":["That's a laser.","We cut steel with them now.","We actually do surgery with lasers.","You know when some people have either scars or birth marks that they don't want to see?","We can actually remove those with lasers now.","Never seen a laser light show?","When they light up the sky with lasers, it's almost like fireworks."],"802":["Oh you got to see a shooting star?","Well that's cool, that's nature giving you the show there.","So what do you think about lasers?","You think they're fun?"],"803":["The green one.","And the next time you go to a grocery store, take a peek at the red."],"804":["Okay."],"805":["Today we're here to talk about lasers.","So what do you think about lasers?"],"806":["Do you know anything about lasers?","What makes a laser special kind of light."],"807":["Do you even know maybe how to make a laser that it would be strong enough to cut steel?"],"808":["Okay.","[laughing] So one of the things about lasers is, if you've ever seen a laser beam, you know it's very directed."],"809":["What is a laser made out of?","Well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb.","Right?"],"810":["So yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors.","Now the light bulb has to be a little bit special.","It has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right?","It has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along, it takes that energy and becomes stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors, it makes the light come out in a nice beam.","In a laser, it comes out as a single color.","They all come out with their waves at the same time.","Every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power.","So it can do something like cutting steel.","But when you cut steel, or if you were cutting this floor, it's gray, it actually will absorb the light.","That's why the light, you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it.","So I like to use demos to explain how my laser works.","So I've brought basically a hammer and a nail.","I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is, if you asked yourself why it is we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood.","We could never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp end and hope this would go in to the piece of wood."],"811":["That's right.","All the force that we apply here, goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot.","And so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area.","But sometimes it's not even the force per unit area 'cos, you know, push down as hard as you can on that and see if we can get it pushed in.","See it doesn't really work does it?"],"812":["Well it depends.","So if you're cutting steel, you need to have the nail.","You need to have it concentrated all of the light, not going in all directions but you need it into as small a point as possible.","And for that we use a lens.","For a lens, the light's coming down as a column, you put in a lens, it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel.","Okay so that force per unit area--"],"813":["Exactly.","You know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in the small volume and so one of the other dimensions is time or length.","But with light, time and length are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light."],"814":["But if you send a one second long light pulse out into the skies there, the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon.","It's 300,000 kilometers long.","So now, if you talk about light being concentrated, that doesn't seem very concentrated.","The type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper.","So we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper and so, in my lab, pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them.","'Cos they don't come in our eyes, they fly by us and they're infra red."],"815":["Exactly.","And so now, if we have light like that that we wanna machine with.","I bring this funnel and so, if we had a lens here and the light was coming down--"],"816":["Into a spot.","So here would be my light coming from my laser and it would just be coming down, down, down, down, down.","Hit a lens and it would have to focus down.","But now, all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much.","Eventually it would be here, more concentrated.","But by the end, right at the focal spot, that's when I get all of my light, all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer.","Because when this hits a piece of glass, it just smacks hose electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do, they have to fly away.","So can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light?"],"817":["So do you think that lasers are fun enough to talk with your friends about or?"],"818":["[Donna] So you're a college student?"],"819":["[Donna] And what's your major?"],"820":["Excellent.","I got an engineering physics degree.","There you go, something in common.","We're here today talking about lasers.","So have you have had much exposure to lasers yet at school?"],"821":["Okay.","As opposed to the experimental side and seeing things?","Okay so I'm much more, I like to see the things happening.","So then the question is, what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things up?","Certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and when the laser light comes in and just smacks the electrons right off the atom.","And so the question really is how do you make that?","Back in the 70s and into the 80s, I know that was a long time ago for you, we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers, we couldn't have big energy, short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification.","Have you heard of chirped pulse amplification by any chance?"],"822":["Well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirped pulse amplification works.","Our short pulses are made of different colors.","So I've got a colored slinky here.","We probably could've called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped.","The word chirped comes around because birds chirp.","When the birds are singing, the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp.","The point is is that when all the light is squeezed together like this, it's a short pulse.","And that's when it's a hammer because all of the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small, then all of that light at the focal spot, concentrate.","And so that was the laser hammer.","So we can't have that in the laser.","So the question is what could we do?","The fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion, travel different speeds inside material.","So we used a long fiber, 1.4 kilometers of fiber but, in fiber, the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time interacting and they travel fast.","The red is going to start traveling faster than the green, faster than the blue and, as you travel down the fiber, next thing you know, you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back.","And so the frequencies go hoo!","Like this okay?","So this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse.","And so, first this is what we did, we chirped it, we stretched it, then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and, after we amplify it, then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being a short pulse but a high energy pulse.","And then we really had what I like to call a laser hammer.","When this laser pulse goes inside, it smacks those electrons right off the atom."],"823":["Well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along, they were only single color.","Your cat toy, would only be a single color, probably a red one and so that's just one color.","And one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time.","One color is one wave length of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on.","If you want a short pulse, you actually have to have all the colors.","And if you can imagine that one point in time, and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra.","When you're listening to an orchestra warm up, they sound terrible, they're all playing their own notes.","But when the conductor conducts them, they all play different notes but, together, it's beautiful music.","So we have something in the laser called a mode locker and it's like the conductor and it says go now.","And all the colors will start together but some colors are long wave length and others are shorter.","So next thing you know, you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other.","And the more colors you can bring in, the faster that happens and the shorter the pulse you can make."],"824":["The necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel prize.","It's sold at the Nobel museum and it is a chirped pulse.","So we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications, what have you learned about chirped pulses?"],"825":["[Donna] So I understand you're in grad school.","Where?"],"826":["And what are you studying?"],"827":["And what kind of laser do you use?"],"828":["Do you know a lot about lasers?","Or just about the laser that you use."],"829":["Okay.","So this is about high intensity lasers.","Not only how do you make them, but what was really stopping them being made in both cases is non linear optics.","We wanna do something that requires a huge photon density application, and so that's how come we came up with chirped pulse amplification, so that we could stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end.","So what do you think the main difference is between the continuous wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier?"],"830":["And so we get the power with a lot less energy 'cause its power is energy per unit time.","So we aren't depositing much energy in comparison.","Can I just ask, 'cause you are using the thermal process of it heating up, but have you ever had the opportunity to use laser tweezers?"],"831":["And twirl the motors or not twirl the motors?"],"832":["You haven't?","Okay."],"833":["So chirped pulse amplification took us sort of from, we were at 10 to the 12, but when I was working the 10 to the 12 sort of sat on a football sized field.","It was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse.","And we brought it down to something we call tabletop terawatt.","So it was the same terawatt but now it was one joule and one picosecond, so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab.","We were able to take that up to, I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter.","So then in going forward, one of the holy grails is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter?","So we still have six orders.","So we've gone from 10 to the 12 to 10 to the 23.","So we've done 11 orders, so you think six isn't so much harder.","I have to tell you, over time, it's rolling over.","We need another Nobel Prize winning idea.","But if we get out there, that's where, if you focus the intensity, the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum."],"834":["Yes.","And maybe what, do pump-probe spectroscopy and watch the cell?","Or to ionize it?"],"835":["I don't know if people are working on that because I'm not so much in the medical field, but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility.","So after hearing about high intensity lasers, can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the lab with lasers, can you see how short pulses might help you?"],"836":["That's true.","Thank you very much."],"837":["Good to see you Mike, nice to have you here with me.","So we go way back.","1991, the year I got married, I moved across the country, left my husband in New Jersey, to work with you in Livermore."],"838":["And stay there."],"839":["You could not convince me to stay, no."],"840":["And I've been talking sort of, started with sort of what is a laser through linear optics, non linear optics, high intensity laser physics, and saying that you know, we're trying to get to that Schwinger limit of 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter.","We're about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point.","But even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength, we're not at 10 to the 29.","So you're hoping to build the biggest laser."],"841":["At Rochester.","But we're still not gonna get to the Schwinger limit, isn't that right?"],"842":["That's right, if you can do that, go for it."],"843":["Okay, but that's kind of cheating.","That's not getting to 10 to the 29.","If you could do it with 100% efficiency that's all we need."],"844":["That's the Nobel Prize winning idea though if we can come up with it."],"845":["We have to get into entertainment.","When is the high intensity laser gonna get into entertainment so then there's real money?"],"846":["No."],"847":["I don't like science fiction."],"848":["So we can either cheat by doing laser accelerating and going into that rest frame."],"849":["And that's, like you said, we're stuck a little bit, we're not up to that kind of acceleration, so that would be a Nobel Prize winning possible idea."],"850":["Or we need, going around and giving my talks now, I show how we're plateauing.","I showed how there was a plateau, CPA raises it up, but we're sort of starting to plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea.","And so do you think it's on the horizon?","Do you see anything out there that really says, oh yeah that's a good way to go?","'Cos we're gonna have to get out to the x-rays right?","We can't stay in the visual."],"851":["Okay."],"852":["And right across the beam.","Don't you think that's gonna be the challenge?","'Cos it's not like our beams are as perfect as we like to think they are."],"853":["Okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so, what do you think the real fun is?","What do you see the real excitement being?"],"854":["So it is amazing, the parallels.","And optics is used everywhere.","We're gonna possibly take over from CERN, we'll just do high energy physics with lasers, we're looking at gravity waves with lasers, we wanna do black holes with lasers, we wanna machine with lasers, we wanna do medicine with lasers.","It's everywhere.","And now, with the Nobel prize, people are hearing more about it so they know lasers are everywhere."],"855":["There you go."],"856":["Okay.","And only one Canadian.","There you go!","[laughing]"],"857":["Today was fun, I got to explain the work I do at all levels.","It's always fun for me to talk to elementary school students because they bring such enthusiasm.","With a student who's already started to learn optics, to a graduate student and finally my own colleague where we can really get into a huge conversation about what's the future of this field.","Electronics was the technology for the 20th century and it brought us the transistor.","Electrons don't move nearly as fast as light and so, trust me photonics will take us where we wanna go in this century."],"858":["Yes."],"859":["Yes."],"860":["So we learned how to actually light up a light bulb."],"861":["I don't know--"],"862":["No."],"863":["Flashlight is a bigger shine and the laser is just a dot."],"864":["[Harmoni] The laser."],"865":["The laser."],"866":["Yes."],"867":["Yes."],"868":["Yeah."],"869":["Yes."],"870":["I don't have a cat or--"],"871":["Yes."],"872":["Yes."],"873":["Well I saw a shooting star before."],"874":["Yes they're very cool.","I like the one where you did the green one."],"875":["Okay."],"876":["I think they're pretty cool.","They show up in a lot of my favorite books and movies.","Like Star Wars or just a bunch of different sci-fi movies and books."],"877":["All I really know is from sci-fi books and movies and like the factory cutting lasers that they use to cut steel and stuff."],"878":["No."],"879":["Like what are they made out of?"],"880":["So it's a beam?"],"881":["Because it needs to be centered so it can more easily just go in."],"882":["So the laser needs ultimately many things.","It needs to be centered, it needs time to actually penetrate and then it needs--"],"883":["So it's kind of like a magnifying glass?","Like it magnifies the light down to a point?"],"884":["Exactly."],"885":["There'd be like little concentrated beams of light just flying everywhere?"],"886":["It funnels into--"],"887":["Well what I learned, lasers they aren't like particles.","They're more like a super concentrated beam of light that can be any color.","They get really concentrated and that's what makes them lasers and that's why they cut things and break things because they just move the electrons out of the way."],"888":["Of course I'm gonna have to share something about my experience.","Learning about lasers with an expert like you."],"889":["Yes."],"890":["I'm an engineering physics major with a minor in math.","I'm in the three, two program for biomedical engineering."],"891":["Not yet.","I'm really hoping that we will.","I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side of physics."],"892":["Vaguely."],"893":["So the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the chirped is it still the same premise?"],"894":["What's the pendant?"],"895":["I learned that it all stretches, which is super cool, because red moves the fastest and so it kinda tugs around blue.","It really threw me off just how fast.","It's hard to imagine things happening that fast.","And I also learned how many of the things that I know are lasers.","Like how many of the things that I've been looking for, like, the answers to, it is in lasers."],"896":["At NYU."],"897":["I'm studying soft matter physics, which involves the physics of squishy stuff.","We make microswimmers in the laboratory and we drive them with a laser."],"898":["We use a 10 watt laser, it's a fiber laser."],"899":["Not a lot, just a little bit."],"900":["I feel like the continuous laser delivers power at a continuous rate, whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really, really short time with your amplification."],"901":["I have, yeah.","We use optical tweezers to trap particles in solution."],"902":["No, I haven't worked with that."],"903":["So I was always curious, how much further, like what higher power can we go now?"],"904":["We could probably use this to drive chemical reactions at a very, very specific spot.","Like if we want to target just a single cell in the body."],"905":["I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to, let's say destroy one cell, like a tumor cell or something like that.","So that the neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell burns."],"906":["I think short pulses might help in my experiment in the sense that if I drive my swimmers with a continuous wave as opposed to a pulsed wave, maybe a continuous wave would heat up the sample too much and a pulse laser would deliver power exactly where I need it so that I could run my experiment longer."],"907":["Thank you, Donna.","It was really nice to meet you."],"908":["Hello Donna, good to see you."],"909":["I remember very much and how hard it was to convince you to travel across the country and work at the lab."],"910":["And stay there.","[laughing]"],"911":["I couldn't convince you to stay."],"912":["But you were there long enough to make a big impression and get some good work done."],"913":["Yes."],"914":["So just a little bit of back history again.","After you demonstrated CPA, I was intrigued by how powerful could we make lasers?","And then how lasers are wonderful because they allow you to take energy and compress it in space and time.","So having high P power is something, it's been a motivator for me for a long time.","And so we at the university are making proposals to build two 25 petawatt lasers, maybe 30 petawatt lasers.","We'll use them to be able to get combined power of over 10 to the 24 watts per square center.","Still far from the Schwinger limit.","But we have a trick.","We're going to use one of these petawatt lasers to make an electron beam.","And this electron beam will be relativistic.","We actually think we could make electron beam, maybe even 100s of GeV up to TeV, which would be another Nobel Prize if we did that."],"915":["And then we will shine that laser onto that electron beam, and the electron's rest frame, we beat the Schwinger limit."],"916":["That's why I wanna cheat."],"917":["Because again, if we're able to do this, with ways I can see today.","Right?","I can see us doing it today, by just exploiting what we already know and taking it to a limit, then that would be a real motivator, I think, to be able to even take these techniques further.","Cheating's not the right exact word as taking advantage of relativity.","Take advantage of all physics not just optical physics.","So that's why we wanna do it this way."],"918":["Yes, yes, well we have Star Trek, we had the photon torpedoes.","I always thought they actually knew what you were doing, there's a photon torpedo.","Have you ever seen that in--"],"919":["[Michael] Oh."],"920":["Oh no, Star Trek had photon torpedoes and they showed bursts of light about this long.","It was a CPA, it was a few nanosecond pulse.","Didn't say how much energy it carried, and you could see it.","I don't know what it was gathering off of but you could see it, so it was a great thing."],"921":["Yes."],"922":["Absolutely."],"923":["So actually there's a potential ways of doing it with optical or near optical radiation.","And there's been a lot of work done in the defense department and so on, how do I combine laser beams together?"],"924":["And make them act as one coherent source.","So one of the things that we'll be doing with our two petawatts, we're going to see if we can actually combine them into a 50.","If you can do that, you can begin to imagine doing this with many lasers.","Many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about.","So one could possibly see an exawatt from that.","People have been able to combine 10s of lasers together for a coherent source so you have to be able to phase lock them, you have to be able to make their phases be exactly connected and related and be able, as they propagate through all the different optical components, whatever it may be--"],"925":["So that's right so you have to have the aperture size, you have to have them phase locked across the entire aperture.","Which will be a great challenge and people have done it, again, with small lasers.","The lasers we'll be trying to do is about a 40cm aperture.","So we'll begin to start looking at this.","And actually wavelength control and then be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now.","For defense applications, for science applications.","So we will do our best to make use of all these technologies.","Lasers I think have progressed so much.","Just like the semi conductor did, 'cos there's such a market for it, there were so many different applications for that."],"926":["I remember when laser was first demonstrated 1960, what could we do with this?","We already got light.","Now we can't live without lasers.","My cell phone, that is in my pocket, has billions of transistors.","How is that made?","With lasers.","All of the greatest circuitry is done with lasers.","Actually now it's using x-rays, made from laser heated matter.","That came out of the laser fusion program."],"927":["[Michael] I couldn't agree with you more and you winning the Nobel prize has been an inspiration to lots of people.","Only three women have won the Nobel prize in physics and only one educated in the United States.","You."],"928":["And I use that every place."],"929":["Hi, I'm Sean Carroll.","I'm a theoretical physicist here at the California Institute of Technology.","I've been challenged to explain dimensions to five different levels.","The idea of a dimension, sometimes in pop culture is misunderstood, like there's an extra place you can go, a mystical dimension or something like that.","To a physicist or a mathematician, a dimension is just the direction you can go in.","Up down, left right, forward backward.","To you and me, we think there's three dimensions around us, but then physicists start talking about extra dimensions.","How can you hide them?","Where might they be?","I'm hopeful that we're learn something at each level."],"930":["We're gonna talk about some science.","Do you like science?"],"931":["Oh, very good.","You've come to the right place.","So we're gonna think about physics.","Have you heard the word physics before?","Do you know what that is?"],"932":["What's your idea what physics is?"],"933":["Okay.","I just think of physics as the study of everything.","What stuff is, what stuff does.","So today we're gonna talk about space, and in particular the idea of dimensions.","Have you heard about dimensions?"],"934":["3D printing, good."],"935":["But do you know what 3D means?"],"936":["Three dimensional, as opposed to, what is ordinary printing?"],"937":["What do you say when something is one dimensional?","What's an example of something that's one dimensional?"],"938":["A line is the perfect example"],"939":["Because it's one thing that's straight, right?"],"940":["So here's some toys.","We're gonna build some dimensions, right?","So what would you say about this?"],"941":["Exactly.","It's not really one dimensional, right?"],"942":["And how would you find yourself, like if someone said where are you, could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line?"],"943":["But here's what I want you to think about.","If I say I'm at this point on the line, I could translate that into saying I'm at the three centimeter point, if I were here I'd be at the four centimeter point, the five centimeter point, right?"],"944":["So every point, every location on our little line--"],"945":["Has its own unit, has one number."],"946":["We need one number to tell you where we are.","That's one dimension.","That's what it means to be one dimensional.","I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are."],"947":["There you go.","Exactly.","We're gonna build a little two dimensional space.","You wanna do it?","You wanna do the honors here?","Why don't you put those two lines together?"],"948":["Exactly, there you go."],"949":["I think you should be in this chair and you should be explaining this to me.","You're much better at this than I am."],"950":["So those are the dimensions.","That's how we think about dimensions.","Remember, we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line, we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane."],"951":["There you go."],"952":["So, do you think we could have more than three dimensions?"],"953":["Well, as far as we know."],"954":["This is why physicists think about things we don't know about.","We're wondering whether there could be extra dimensions you've never seen.","Yeah.","That are tinier than atoms.","So, okay.","So what have you learned?","What do you know about dimensions now?","How do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before?"],"955":["Yeah, do you think you'd be excited if physicists said that they found extra dimensions of space?"],"956":["I think so.","I think you're right.","All right Hank, we want you to keep up studying, learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions some day.","Does that sound like a fun idea?"],"957":["Do you like science?","Is that something you think about?"],"958":["[Sean] What kind of science?"],"959":["All right, you're in the wrong place.","[laughs] We're not gonna be talking about biology or computer science.","So we wanna talk about the idea of dimensions.","Do you know what dimension is?","How we would define dimensions?"],"960":["Right, you know the difference between like one dimension two dimensions, three dimensions, et cetera.","So let's do a little experiment here.","So there's one dimension.","I'll give that to you.","Now, here's your task.","I'm going to give you another dimension, and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other.","It's easy to do.","Yeah, so there's no trick here."],"961":["I'm not trying to fool you here.","Okay.","Now this is going to be slightly trickier.","I'm going to give you this.","I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time."],"962":["There you go.","So what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two dimensional plane, right?","Like the two things pick out a plane, the three things pick out all three dimensional space.","I'm gonna give you one more, and I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time."],"963":["All right, now I am tricking you.","It can't be done.","Yeah.","Right?","You can't do it.","So we just experimentally proved that space is three dimensional.","That's sort of what it means to be three dimensional, that there are three different directions you can move in and there's not four or five or six directions you can move in."],"964":["There you go.","Three dimensional space, right?"],"965":["[Sean] So, have you thought about using coordinates in three dimensions?"],"966":["There you go.","[laughing]"],"967":["That's right.","So that's exactly what these would be.","Have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYX?"],"968":["Well, we could also say how far we are away from the center, just the distance.","And then the angle that our little line makes with let's say the X axis."],"969":["So that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself, and we call those polar coordinates.","It's a different coordinate system.","What we want to do as physicists is look for extra dimensions.","Can you imagine, can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions?"],"970":["Time.","Yes, Einstein said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension, and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself.","But what about space?","What about the solar system?","Like, if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky, do you know how we do that?"],"971":["It's exactly the same thing as latitude and longitude but we put coordinates on the sky."],"972":["So astronomers call them right ascension and declination, which are two terrible words, but basically you've seen on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude, what it looks like."],"973":["[Sean] And sort of the peels of an orange kind of thing, right?"],"974":["So you can define something as, well you know, how high above a certain location on earth it is, but the earth is rotating and revolving around the sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates."],"975":["We don't know.","You know, the optimistic view is that there are six, but the thing is, some of them might be really, really, really, really, really small, like way too small for us to ever see."],"976":["And some of them might be medium sized that hopefully we can see."],"977":["Absolutely right.","And this is sort of the state of uncertainty that physicists are stuck living in."],"978":["You know, honestly out there, if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists, half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist, and half of them say no, that's just nonsense."],"979":["[Sean] We really don't know."],"980":["Okay, after all this."],"981":["Someone comes up to you on the street and says what's a dimension?"],"982":["That's right, and you know, if they're still bugging you you can just like give them some sticks and ask them to put them together."],"983":["[Sean] And that would shut them up."],"984":["Where do you go to school and what do you study?"],"985":["Oh, math and physics, okay.","What kind of physicist do you want to be?","Do you know?"],"986":["Usually if it's math and physics, you end up as a theoretical physicist, right?"],"987":["Not an experimental one.","So, our theme here today is dimensions.","So this is great that you have some math background because mathematicians think about dimensions in a different way."],"988":["So how would you explain to your friends who are not math and physics majors, like what is a dimension, yourself?"],"989":["Mm-hmm."],"990":["That's exactly right, and so you've heard of spacetime--"],"991":["[Sean] Being four dimensional, right?"],"992":["Now, in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me, because of course you have space, which is three dimensional, you have time which is one dimensional, so spacetime is four dimensional.","But it didn't turn out, it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity.","This is the crucial thing, right?","Is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space, but how we divide spacetime into time and space can be different for different people, and really there's a real sense in which four dimensional spacetime is kind of a generalization of three dimensional space.","And I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard."],"993":["Let's bring one in.","All right.","The thing about relativity is that they really want you to think of spacetime as one four dimensional thing, right?","It's kind of like space.","It's not just three dimensions of space and one dimension of time."],"994":["Why?","This is a very good question.","So, let's just start with space, right?","We know a little bit about space.","So here's my simple minded way of drawing space two dimensions, because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard.","Let's say X and Y.","And what is special about space, there's many things, but one is that if I have a curve or a path between two points, there's a distance that you can calculate, right?","And the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates.","It doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates, or whatever.","I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points, and if I were a person walking on that curve, I would have an odometer with me maybe, and I would know, you would know, even without having done that, this path is always gonna be longer than that path.","There's a formula, Pythagoras' Theorem that tells you what the shortest distance path is.","That's the point.","The physical-ness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve.","So spacetime is like that.","That's why it is useful to think about spacetime."],"995":["So let me draw spacetime.","Here's how we usually draw it.","I'll just say X, but all of space is condensed in this one direction, and this is time, okay?","So if you're a little person and you started some event, so you start, you're located somewhere in space, somewhere in the three coordinates of space, and whether you like it or not, you're moving through spacetime just by getting older."],"996":["When people ask me can you travel through time?","I say yes, yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and here I am, a day later.","So that's just this.","Okay, you're moving through time, like it or not.","So what Einstein says is look, I can travel through spacetime in different ways, like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back, and then I could meet you there.","So this is a different trajectory through spacetime, right?"],"997":["And it's almost exactly like the space story.","The space story says there's a distance, distance is different along different curves.","Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves, and we call it the proper time.","It is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch."],"998":["Well kind of.","What Einstein wants to get across is there's no such thing as fundamental, like there's the universe's time, this big letter T that might tell you how old the universe is, but then every individual has a clock with them, and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universe."],"999":["And the crucial difference is that time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair, and this person who zoomed out there."],"1000":["There is what we call a metric on spacetime, and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space, versus a sphere or something, that's a different metric.","And spacetime has its own metric which says the following thing, that the path between two events in spacetime that is a straight line, will always be the longest time."],"1001":["[Sean] That's the difference."],"1002":["So when Einstein had this idea, oh gravity could be related to the curvature of spacetime, he did some equations, so he got it, that's a long story, we'll put that aside.","What he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of spacetime, it's a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime so when you have like the earth, the sun, the moon, they cause a gravitational field, they're actually warping the spacetime around them.","They're giving it a different geometry."],"1003":["Yeah, exactly.","If you had a sheet that was originally flat, and you set a marble on it, it would go in a straight line, but then if you put something on it so it warps it, that marble is now gonna be deflected."],"1004":["Einstein says that gravity is just like that."],"1005":["But there are no straight lines, because spacetime itself is curved.","So do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say?"],"1006":["Yeah, that's right.","And it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board where how those two people in the train and on the ground would divide spacetime up differently to space and time."],"1007":["[Sean] Yeah.","I learned a lot.","[Sean] It's a lot of fun stuff to talk about."],"1008":["So observational cosmology, so like what do you look at?"],"1009":["I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions a little bit."],"1010":["Well I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space.","What is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen?"],"1011":["Right."],"1012":["Mm-hmm."],"1013":["It does.","In fact, one way that different universes might be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions.","Like we have three dimensions around us, but there's people out there, aliens, who could live in five dimensional universes."],"1014":["It's a, yeah."],"1015":["We think that it would be, no all of this is incredibly speculative, and we don't know for sure.","But the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same, but they show up differently, so they appear different.","So the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse."],"1016":["Why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions, right?","So you've heard of string theory?"],"1017":["Mm-hmm.","So we have quantum mechanics, right?","The theory of atoms and so forth and how those work, and then we have gravity, and gravity doesn't seem to fit in.","It's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical framework, so string theory is one of the best ideas."],"1018":["That's the good news.","The bad news is that it only seems to work if spacetime is ten dimensional.","[chuckles] So you would say well then it's wrong.","It can't be right.","Spacetime is not ten-dimensional.","Spacetime is four dimensional.","We've observed that.","But instead, we say if spacetime looks four dimensional to us, but string theory, which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be ten dimensional, maybe we can hide those extra six dimensions somehow.","So here's how we could get lucky.","We could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them.","This is actually an old idea.","It goes back to Kaluza and Klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915.","But there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions.","There could be extra dimensions that are actually that big, like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed.","But here's the new, exciting idea.","So let's imagine, okay.","This is a piece of paper.","But let's imagine this is our entire world.","So, in other words, our real world is three dimensional, but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions, so we all live here.","You and I live here.","But let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space.","So there are extra dimensions that are actually big, okay?","And let's imagine that.","When I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of, right, the quarks, the leptons, the electrons and everything, all the forces we know about, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, imagine they can't leave this surface.","This is what we call a brane.","B-R-A-N-E. Have you heard this word before?"],"1019":["[Sean] Do you know where it comes from?"],"1020":["From membranes, you know.","We have lines, one dimension.","We have two dimensional surfaces.","So if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing, you call it a string, right?"],"1021":["If you have a two dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing, we call that a membrane.","Membrane theory goes back, it never was as popular as string theory, but it's been around for a while.","But if you had extra dimensions of space, then you can three dimensional vibrating things, and four dimensional vibrating things."],"1022":["Well basically the strings are the particles that we see.","It's exactly the same thing as we said for the straw, if you look at it far away it looks one dimensional.","A little loop of string, so a little one dimensional circle that is vibrating.","If you look at it from very, very far away, it just looks like a particle.","So in string theory, an electron is a little string.","A photon is a little string."],"1023":["Yes, string theory's even better.","So the phrase Grand Unified Theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism.","So a good string theory is gravity plus the Grand Unified Theory."],"1024":["It's even better.","It's the theory of everything.","What would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are, what extra dimensions are, what a brane is?"],"1025":["That's right.","And we could live there.","The world we see around us, the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brane trying to escape."],"1026":["You're a string theorist, so tell us what kind of string theory you do, what it means to be a string theorist."],"1027":["Cool, so do you think a lot about extra dimensions in your everyday life?"],"1028":["And so when you think about extra dimensions, you put them together with brains and different fields wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth, right?"],"1029":["You know, a lot of people, a lot of string theorists, they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions.","As someone who cares about cosmology, I wanna start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all?","How did that happen?","Is this something you think about yourself?"],"1030":["The thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realize there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously, dynamically.","If you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything, but within some region of space you could make a tube."],"1031":["Right?","And down there in the tube it looks like your long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extending in the other direction, so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space."],"1032":["[Sean] You think that sounds plausible to you?"],"1033":["Yeah.","So we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point, and it's worse than that.","So in our paper we imagine you start in de Sitter space.","You start in a universe with no matter, no anything like that, just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large."],"1034":["It was always there."],"1035":["Why not?"],"1036":["Well you know, I think that this is again, this is--"],"1037":["I would say that we shouldn't be prejudiced one way or the other."],"1038":["Yeah, so let me tell you a little bit more about the scenario.","So you know there are black holes, good?","Right?"],"1039":["[Sean] There are black branes as well."],"1040":["Why don't you explain to us what a black brane is?"],"1041":["Yeah, I've been trying to explain this to lower levels, and they always look at me like, are you pulling my leg here a little bit?","Or is this the real thing that they use?","Yes, it is the real thing they use.","We study these branes in de Sitter space, and so what we found is that there are black brane solutions which instead of having a singularity inside are non-singular, and stable, and compactified.","Is this a familiar thing?","I know things like this have been discussed, right?"],"1042":["Right.","Imagine that rather than going down to a point, it just asymptotes to some fixed radius that continues infinitely far down there.","But then you can ask, okay what about the rest of the universe?","You have some sphere, some two dimensions compactified, and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a fixed distance."],"1043":["But then the other dimensions, the transverse dimensions, don't need to be anti-de Sitter.","They can have either positive, zero, or negative cosmological constant.","So you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere."],"1044":["I guess.","I mean, maybe you'd think otherwise.","Again or maybe you could change my mind, I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time, right?"],"1045":["I mean it's one of the things that could happen, so I mean it obviously, You know, we know--"],"1046":["It's quantum.","[laughing] It's a loud, it's of a loud it's gonna happen."],"1047":["Someone probably wrote it for him.","So it's possible that if you do have this starting point of an empty de Sitter space with positive cosmological constants and fields lying around you inevitably get a multiverse.","It just happens, you know, it's just part of quantum nucleation to different things, and then maybe you need to explain why we live in this universe rather than some other one via the anthropic principle or something like that.","So how does our kind of, you know, low-tech old fashioned way of making new universes intersect with the kinds of things you'd think about."],"1048":["They overlap, they wrap around."],"1049":["I know not everyone buys that, right?"],"1050":["And if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics, and it's just amongst us chickens, what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory, and the dynamics of these extra dimensions?"],"1051":["If the viewers wanted to know more about how spacetime can emerge from quantum mechanics, they could read the graphic novel you just wrote."],"1052":["And I just wrote a book called Something Deeply Hidden about many worlds, quantum mechanics, and how spacetime can emerge from it.","Plenty of reading material for the audience out there."],"1053":["So that was fun.","I hope that everyone did learn something.","I know that I did.","It was very nice to see how the idea of dimensions and space resonates in different ways with different people, all the way up to talking to Clifford about the forefront of modern research.","I really do think that we're not done understanding how dimensions work.","There are three dimensions of space, why that?","Why not two?","Why not 27?","I think that we really don't yet have the data or ideas to think about this, but we're creeping up on it.","I'm optimistic about progress in the near future."],"1054":["Yes, a lot."],"1055":["Yeah, kind of."],"1056":["Um, I'm not so sure."],"1057":["At the camp I made a 3D printing one."],"1058":["So I don't choose the size, all I had to do was the shape."],"1059":["It's three dimensional."],"1060":["So, ordinary printing would be 2D."],"1061":["Hmm, I think one dimensional might be a circle, I guess, or maybe a line."],"1062":["Yeah, a line."],"1063":["[Hank] Yeah."],"1064":["That's one dimensional."],"1065":["So everything has to be one or two dimensional before it's three dimensional."],"1066":["I think I would be maybe there, since I'm facing it."],"1067":["Yeah."],"1068":["Has its own unit."],"1069":["Yeah."],"1070":["Unlike three dimensional, you have to tell a lot 'cause if it's like a sphere, you kind of have to start using points."],"1071":["If you make it two dimensional is this, a corner."],"1072":["Another way is if you have space in between is an angle."],"1073":["Yeah."],"1074":["I think that would be an X or a Y axis, so--"],"1075":["3D is the maximum of dimensions for shapes."],"1076":["Yeah."],"1077":["So at least everything has a certain dimension."],"1078":["That would be an amazing discovery.","The news would be spreaded around the world rapidly."],"1079":["Yeah."],"1080":["Yeah, I do."],"1081":["I like biology and computer science."],"1082":["I guess, I don't know how to exactly define it, but I know, like the first four."],"1083":["[laughing] Yeah."],"1084":["Um ..."],"1085":["Um ..."],"1086":["Okay."],"1087":["Mm-hmm."],"1088":["Yeah, I was actually doing SAT prep."],"1089":["It showed like the X Y and Z axis as well."],"1090":["No."],"1091":["Yeah."],"1092":["Time?"],"1093":["I have no idea."],"1094":["Oh."],"1095":["[Juliana] Yeah."],"1096":["[Juliana] Yeah."],"1097":["So, there's like how many dimension would there be?"],"1098":["Yeah."],"1099":["Oh, okay.","So since it's all theoretical, like this could not be three dimensional."],"1100":["Oh.","[laughs]"],"1101":["Oh.","[laughs]"],"1102":["Yeah."],"1103":["[Juliana] Yeah."],"1104":["Oh, man.","I mean, I guess what I've learned today is just that there are not just three dimensions or at least we think, I mean everything's theoretical.","It's all just really kind of confusing."],"1105":["Oh yeah."],"1106":["Yeah."],"1107":["I'm gonna be a sophomore at Pomona College, and I study math and physics."],"1108":["I really don't know.","I like theory and experimental so it's kind of tough for me to say."],"1109":["Yeah."],"1110":["Hopefully, yeah."],"1111":["My first intuitive thought is what are the coordinates."],"1112":["So if we are looking at things, if we're looking at like a dot, or a line rather, that's one dimensional because we can only measure it one way, but then if we look at like a square then we're increasing like that, so it's basically what coordinates we can use to measure something."],"1113":["Yeah."],"1114":["Mm-hmm."],"1115":["Okay."],"1116":["Why though?"],"1117":["Okay."],"1118":["Yeah."],"1119":["Yeah."],"1120":["So it's kind of like our fundamental time?","Or our base time?"],"1121":["I see."],"1122":["Why is that, that this one's shorter then?"],"1123":["I see.","Oh, okay."],"1124":["All right."],"1125":["Would it be if I had like a spring or not a spring, but like a sheet, and I dropped a book in the sheet, curves down?"],"1126":["I see."],"1127":["I see."],"1128":["I think I'd go with kind of the train paradox.","Let's say I'm stationary, and someone's moving past me on the train, they think they're stationary on the train.","Like they think that they're not accelerating, but if they start walking through the train cars, then they are accelerating in their frame, but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed, I see they are accelerating.","So I guess that relativity is all about perspective, I guess in a way."],"1129":["That was pretty good."],"1130":["So, I work on two ground-based surveys in the optical, and we're basically trying to make huge maps of the universe so that we can study dark energy."],"1131":["I've heard it, yeah."],"1132":["I get a little scared, [laughing] because I think how can you prove these theories?"],"1133":["One theory I've heard of, I don't know if this fits in with that, is bubble universes."],"1134":["Is that an extra dimension?","Does that fit into that, or is that something?"],"1135":["And are each of those dimensions, are they governed by the same laws of physics, or is there like a separate Lagrangian for each universe--"],"1136":["[Bela] Or how does that work?"],"1137":["Okay."],"1138":["I have.","So string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity."],"1139":["Right."],"1140":["I've heard it, yeah."],"1141":["No."],"1142":["Right."],"1143":["So how do these strings give rise to things like mass and charge, and basically give us the properties of the particles that we see?"],"1144":["So, is string theory part of what they call the Grand Unified Theory?","Is it supposed to be the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together?"],"1145":["Okay."],"1146":["So we have three spatial dimensions.","A brane is sort of the next level.","So a brane is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space."],"1147":["It was really cool to learn about strings and branes and how looking at gravity on small scales is actually connected to what I do in looking at gravity on these cosmological scales, and it's definitely something I'm gonna think about in my research."],"1148":["One of the things that's key in the whole story of string theory is the piece of it that talks about quantum theories of gravity.","So I'm very excited about what happens to spacetime, what does it even mean at the quantum level."],"1149":["Uh, yes I do."],"1150":["Yes."],"1151":["Yes, well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe.","If string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about, we'd like to know, with all of these possibilities that are in string theory, how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in?"],"1152":["Okay."],"1153":["Hmm.","Okay, that's nice."],"1154":["It sounds like fun.","What I would immediately ask is where do the large dimensions come from in the first place?","Is that something you address, or you just assume that all the dimension are large as a starting point?"],"1155":["But where do they come from?"],"1156":["Why?"],"1157":["Okay.","[laughing]"],"1158":["You're replacing one prejudice with a different prejudice."],"1159":["Just a large, ten or 11 dimensions with a cosmological constant doesn't seem like a fundamental starting point.","It sounds like there needs to be something to underlie that.","But it's a fun scenario."],"1160":["I've heard of them."],"1161":["Indeed."],"1162":["Well in some ways, it's very much like a black hole in that you have far away from it you have these large just flat dimensions.","As you move in, there's something in the interior.","It has, itself, higher dimensions, and so because physicists love to joke they thought, well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions.","Let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions, and so they called them P-branes."],"1163":["Yeah.","Yeah.","So, a lot of the branes that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de Sitter spacetimes in various dimensions actually start out as these non-singular type brains, and then you find in the core, there's actually an anti-de Sitter spacetime."],"1164":["Right.","Good, good."],"1165":["Is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly, all the possible solutions?"],"1166":["Okay, that's fair."],"1167":["It's quantum, baby."],"1168":["I still laugh from Keanu Reeves I'm afraid.","[laughing]"],"1169":["Well, it's interesting because there's a lot of activity going on inspired by things we learned from working in anti-de Sitter space where the cosmological constant has the wrong sign.","So you will find that there are a number of papers as many of which you've probably read, probably you've read more of them than I have, which try then to take the different kinds of brains, these extended solutions, and they're many different kinds doing different things, we understand well enough now that we can put them together in various ways.","They intersect, they dissolve inside each other, they wrap each other."],"1170":["They overlap, and you do them in all sorts of different ways and show that you can construct four dimensional universes with a cosmological constant of your desire, depending upon how you did the construction."],"1171":["Not everyone buys it.","There's a big discussion in the literature right now."],"1172":["I think it's gonna get way more interesting than we're currently able to grapple with right now, and I think there are hints of it.","There could be a description of the physics that might be our early universe that is like that molecular description.","And then from that emerges flat spacetimes maybe four, maybe some mechanism tells you it's four and not something else.","I think that's where we're going."],"1173":["Right, yes.","I wrote and drew a graphic novel called The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of Universe."],"1174":["Excellent."],"1175":["Hi, I'm Hilary Mason.","I'm a computer scientist.","And today, I've been asked to explain machine learning in five levels of increasing complexity.","Machine learning gives us the ability to learn things about the world from large amounts of data that we as human beings can't possibly study or appreciate.","So machine learning is when we teach computers to learn patterns from looking at examples in data, such that they can recognize those patterns and apply them to new things that they haven't seen before."],"1176":["Hi."],"1177":["I'm Hilary, what's your name?"],"1178":["Do you know what machine learning means?","Have you heard that before?"],"1179":["So machine learning is a way that we teach computers to learn things about the world by looking at patterns and looking at examples of things.","So can I show you an example of how a machine might learn something?"],"1180":["[Hilary] So is this a dog or a cat?"],"1181":["And this one?"],"1182":["And what makes a dog, a dog and a cat, a cat?"],"1183":["That's true.","Do you think, if we look at these pictures, do you think maybe we could say, Well, they both have pointy ears, but the dogs have a different kind of body and the cats like to stand up a little different.?","Do you think that makes sense?"],"1184":["What about this one?"],"1185":["This one's a jackal.","And it's actually a kind of dog.","But you made a good guess.","That's what machines do too.","They make guesses.","Is this a cat or a dog?"],"1186":["[Hilary] None.","What is it?"],"1187":["And how did you know that it's not a cat or a dog?"],"1188":["And so, you did something pretty amazing there.","Because we asked the question, Is it a cat or a dog?","And you said, I disagree with your question.","It's a human.","So machine learning is when we teach machines to make guesses about what things are based on looking at a lot of different examples.","And I build products that use machine learning to learn about the world and make guesses about things in the world.","When we try to teach machines to recognize things like cats and dogs, it takes a lot of examples.","We have to show them tens of thousands or even millions of examples before they can get even close to as good at it as you are.","Do you have tests in school?"],"1189":["Are those like the practice problems you do before the test?"],"1190":["Which means that in the test, you're not seeing any problems that you don't know how to solve.","As long as you did all your practice, right?"],"1191":["So machines work the same way.","If you show them a lot of examples and give them practice, they'll learn how to guess.","And then when you give them the test, they should be able to do that.","So we looked at eight pictures and you were able to answer really quickly.","But what would you do if I gave you 10 million examples?","Would you be able to do that so quickly?"],"1192":["So one of the differences between people and machines is that people might be a little better at this, but can't look at 10 million different things.","So now that we've been talking about machine learning, is this something you want to learn how to do?"],"1193":["And machine learning is a great way to use all those math skills, all those coding skills, and would be a super cool tool for a spy."],"1194":["Hi.","Are you a student, Lucy?"],"1195":["Congratulations."],"1196":["Have you ever heard of machine learning before?"],"1197":["That's right.","When we teach machines to learn from data, to build a model from that data or a representation of that, and then to make a prediction.","One of the places we often find machine learning in the real world is in things like recommendation systems.","So do you have an artist that you really like?"],"1198":["So I'm gonna look up Melanie Martinez.","And it says here, If you like Melanie Martinez, one of the other songs you might like is by Au\/Ra.","Do you know who that is?"],"1199":["So let's listen to a hint of this song."],"1200":["All right.","So why do you think Spotify might've recommended that song?"],"1201":["And that's actually a really interesting thing to think about because that creepy vibe is something that you can perceive and I can perceive, but it's actually really hard to describe to a machine.","What do you think might go into that?"],"1202":["It's a great question.","The machine can understand whatever we tell it to understand.","So there might be a person thinking about things, like the pitch or the pacing or the tone, or sometimes machines can figure out things about music or images or videos that we don't tell it to discover, but that it can learn from looking at a lot of different examples.","Why do you think companies might use machine learning?"],"1203":["Sometimes, the ads you see are really uncanny.","And I think that's because they're based on so much data.","They know where you live.","They know where your device is.","It's also important to realize that people in aggregate are actually pretty predictable.","Like when we talk to each other, we like to talk about the novel things, like here, we're having this conversation.","We don't do this every day.","But we probably still eat breakfast.","We're gonna eat lunch.","We're gonna eat dinner.","You probably are going to the same home you go to most of the time.","And so, they're able to take that data that we already give them and make predictions based on that as to what ads they should show us."],"1204":["[Hilary laughs]"],"1205":["That's right.","To do machine learning, we use something called algorithms.","Have you heard of algorithms before?"],"1206":["That's right."],"1207":["So there are things that machines are really great at that humans are actually not great at.","And imagine watching every video posted to TikTok every day.","So we just don't have enough time to do that at the rate at which we can actually watch those videos.","But a machine can analyze all of them and then make recommendations to us.","And then thinking about things that machines are bad at and people are good at, people are really great with only one or two examples of learning something new and incorporating that into our model of the world to make good decisions.","Whereas machines often need tens of thousands of examples, and that's not even getting into things like good judgment because we care about people, because we can imagine a future that we want to live in that doesn't exist today.","And that's something that is still uniquely human.","Machines are great at predicting based on what they've seen in the past, but they're not creative.","They're not going to invent.","They're not gonna, you know, really change where we're gonna go.","That's up to us."],"1208":["[Hilary] And what are you majoring in?"],"1209":["So in your studies, have you learned about machine learning?"],"1210":["Absolutely.","And that's a great example because you have models that are operating to do things like figure out if a new email is spam or not.","So what would you think about if you were looking at an email and trying to decide if it went in one category or another?"],"1211":["So these are things we would call features.","And we go through a process where we do feature engineering, where somebody looks at the example and says, Okay, these are the things that I think might allow us to statistically tell the difference from something in one category versus another.","So for example, perhaps you don't speak Russian, you start getting a lot of email in Russian."],"1212":["This is a great question because it really gets to the difference between some of our different tools in our machine learning tool belt in addressing problems like this.","So if we were to use a supervised learning classic classification approach, a person would need to think about those features and creatively come up with them in approach we call the kitchen sink approach, which is just try everything you can possibly think of and see what works.","Unsupervised learning, where we don't have labeled data and we're trying to infer some structure out of the data is you're projecting that data into a space and looking for things like clusters.","And there's a bunch of really fun math about how you do that, how you think about distance and by distance, I mean that if we have two data points in space, how do we decide if they're similar or not?"],"1213":["Supervised learning, we have our labels and we're trying to figure out what statistically indicates if something matches one label or another label.","Unsupervised learning, we don't necessarily have those labels.","That's the thing we're trying to discover.","So reinforcement learning is another technique that we use sometimes.","You can think about it like a turn in a game and you can play, you know, millions and millions of trials so that you're able to develop a system that by experimenting with reinforcement learning can eventually learn to play these games pretty successfully.","Deep learning, which is essentially using neural networks and very large amounts of data to eventually iterate on a network structure that can make predictions."],"1214":["It is, but it also thrives in environments where you have a decision point, a pallet of actions to choose from.","And it actually comes historically from trying to train a robot to navigate a room.","If it bonks into this chair, it can't go forward anymore.","And if it falls into that pit, you know, it's not going to succeed.","But if it keeps exploring, it'll eventually get to the goal."],"1215":["[Hilary] Yes.","[both laugh]"],"1216":["So typically, you would choose deep learning if you have sufficient high quality data, hopefully labeled in a useful way.","If you really are happy not to necessarily understand or be able to interpret what your system is doing or you're willing to invest in another set of work afterwards to understand what the system is doing once you've already trained it.","And this also comes down to the fact that some things are actually really easy to solve with linear regression or simple statistical approaches.","And some things are impossible."],"1217":["You build a system that could actually be useless.","So years ago, I had a client that was a big telecom company and they had a data scientist who built a deep learning system to predict customer churn.","It actually was very accurate, but it wasn't useful because nobody knew why the prediction was what it was.","So they could say, you know, Sunny, you're likely to quit next month.","But they had no idea what to do about it.","And so, I think there are a bunch of failure modes."],"1218":["Yeah.","This is actually a good example of a very real world kind of machine learning problem where the solution to this was to build an interpretable system on top of the accurate predictions not to throw it away, but to do a bunch more work to figure out the why."],"1219":["It's actually fairly new that we're able to solve all of these problems and start to build these products and apply it in businesses and apply it, you know, everywhere.","And so, we're still developing good practices and what it means to be a professional in machine learning.","We're really developing a notion of what good looks like."],"1220":["So would you mind telling me a bit about what you've been working on or interested in lately?"],"1221":["So what are some of the techniques you're applying to look at that debate data?"],"1222":["Do you think there are going to be general principles that guide those decisions?","Because right now, it's generally up to the machine learning engineer to decide what tools they want to apply."],"1223":["So is that where some of that frustration around the lack of controllability and interpretability comes from?"],"1224":["If you train a model off of language off the internet, it sometimes says uncomfortable things or inappropriate things and sometimes really biased things.","Have you ever run into this yourself?","And then how do you think about that problem of potentially even measuring the bias in a model that we've trained?"],"1225":["I imagine in the last few years, we've seen a lot of changes and improvements in the capabilities of NLP systems.","So is there anything in that that you're particularly excited about exploring further?"],"1226":["Yeah, I agree."],"1227":["So, hi Claudia.","It's so great to see you."],"1228":["You know, we first met 10, 11 years ago and machine learning has changed a lot since then."],"1229":["Well, you're absolutely right that the attention machine learning gets has grown dramatically.","20 years ago, going to gatherings and telling people what I was working on and seeing the blank face or the like, Where's the turn?","and walk away.","Like, Oh, no.","The accessibility of the tooling, like, we can now do in, like, five lines of code something that would have taken 500 lines of very mathematical, messy, gnarly code even, you know, five years ago.","And that's not an exaggeration.","And there are tools that mean that pretty much anyone can pick this up and start playing with it and start to build with it.","And that is also really exciting."],"1230":["And part of the challenge of it is not the mathematics of building models, but the challenge is making sure that the data is sufficiently representative, potentially high quality."],"1231":["Right.","And so, to say that another way, when you're collecting data from the real world and then building machine learning systems that automate decisions based on that data, all of the biases and problems that are already in the real world then can be magnified through that machine learning system.","And so, it can make many of these problems much worse."],"1232":["And so, it's not just the provenance of that data, but it's, sort of, deeply understanding, Why does it look the way it looks?","Why was it collected this way?","What are the limitations of it?","We need to think about that in entire process, how we document that process.","This is an issue in companies where somebody might create something that even their peers can't recreate."],"1233":["These are great questions.","So things like actuarial science, operations research, where they actually are not using machine learning as much as you might think.","And then you have other sorts of companies or on the FinTech side, or even the ad tech side of things where they perhaps are using machine learning to the point of even absurdity."],"1234":["So when we think about the next five to 10 years, the things that are really still holding us back are these uneven applications of resources to problems because the problems that get attention are the high value ones in terms of how much money you can make or the things that are fashionable enough that you can publish a paper on it.","So what do you think is holding us back?"],"1235":["I am incredibly optimistic and not... Perhaps it's a personality flaw, but I can't help but look at the potential of the technology to reduce harm, to give us information that help us make better decisions.","And to think that we would choose to address the big problems ahead of us.","I don't think we have a hope of addressing them without figuring out the role that machine learning will play.","And to think that we would then choose not to do that is just unthinkable."],"1236":["I hope you learned something about machine learning.","There has never been a better time to study machine learning because you're now able to build products that have tremendous potential and impact"],"1237":["Hi."],"1238":["I'm Brynn."],"1239":["No."],"1240":["Sure."],"1241":["It's a dog."],"1242":["A cat."],"1243":["Well, dogs are very playful, I think, more than cats.","Cats lick themselves more than dogs, I think."],"1244":["Yeah.","Yeah."],"1245":["A dog.","A cat.","I think, a cat?","Because it's more skinny.","And also, its legs are like really tall and its ears are a little pointy."],"1246":["[Brynn] None."],"1247":["It's humans."],"1248":["Because cats and dogs... Because they walk on their paws and their ears are like right here, not right here, and they don't wear watches."],"1249":["Yeah, I have.","After every unit, we have a review and then we have a test."],"1250":["Well, just like everything that's gonna be on the test is on the review."],"1251":["Yeah."],"1252":["No."],"1253":["Kind of.","Because I kind of want to become a spy.","And we used to do coding, so I may be kind of good at it."],"1254":["Hello."],"1255":["Yes, I just finished ninth grade."],"1256":["Thank you.","It's very exciting."],"1257":["I'm going to assume that it means humans being able to teach machines or robots how to learn themselves?"],"1258":["Yeah, Melanie Martinez."],"1259":["I do not."],"1260":["Okay."],"1261":["Well, I know that in Melanie Martinez's music, she used a lot of the filtered voice to make it sound very deep and low and that song had that."],"1262":["Pitch of the music.","If it's really low or if it's super high, it could know that.","What can the machine understand?"],"1263":["Well, I think things like Facebook or Instagram, they probably use it to target ads."],"1264":["So, you're saying I give them enough data as it is about what I might be talking about or thinking about that they can read my mind,"],"1265":["but just use the data that I've already given them.","And it almost seems like they're watching us."],"1266":["A set of steps or a process carried out to complete something?"],"1267":["So do you think that we've been able to teach machines enough so that they can do things that even we can't do?","And on the opposite side of that, do you think there are things that we can do that a machine might never be able to do?"],"1268":["I'm Sunny."],"1269":["I study Math and Computer Science."],"1270":["Yeah, I have.","So to me, machine learning is essentially exactly what it sounds like.","It's trying to teach a machine specifics about something by inputting a lot of data points and slowly, the machine will build up knowledge about it over time.","For example, my Gmail program, I assume that there would be a lot of, like, machine learning models happening at once, right?"],"1271":["I'd probably look at certain keywords.","Maybe if the recipient and the sender had exchanged emails before and generally, those fell into in the past."],"1272":["Obviously, like the features that you just described are features which a person would have had to think about.","Are there features which, like, the machine itself could learn?"],"1273":["And how do the algorithms themselves usually differ between unsupervised and supervised learning."],"1274":["With reinforcement learning versus deep learning, it seems to me that reinforcement learning, is it sort of like the kitchen sink approach that you were talking about earlier, where you're just kind of trying everything?"],"1275":["Oh, like roombas?"],"1276":["Oh, I didn't realize it was that deep, almost.","Is there a situation which you'd want to use a deep learning algorithm over a reinforcement learning algorithm?"],"1277":["What would be the outcome if you were to choose the, quote-unquote, wrong approach?"],"1278":["Would that be an example of, like, linear regression where the regression is accurate, but, you know, for marketing purposes, it's like, if you don't know why I'm quitting the service, then how can we fix this?"],"1279":["How can we improve machine learning algorithms?"],"1280":["I'm in my first year of a PhD in Computer Science and I'm studying natural language processing and machine learning."],"1281":["I've been looking at understanding persuasion in online text and the ways that we might be able to automatically detect the intent behind that persuasion or who it's targeted at and what makes effective persuasive techniques."],"1282":["Something I'm interested in exploring is how well it works to use deep learning and sort of automatically extracted features from this text versus using some of the more traditional techniques that we have, things like lexicons or some sort of template matching techniques for extracting features from texts.","That's a question I'm just interested in, in general.","When do we really need deep learning versus when can we use something that's a little bit more interpretable, something that's been around for a while?"],"1283":["I definitely think there is, but I also, sort of, see it varying a lot based on the use case, something that, kind of, works out of the box and maybe works a little bit more automatically might be better.","And in other cases, you do, sort of, kind of, you want a lot of fine grain control."],"1284":["Yeah, if you're building a model that just predicts the next thing based off of everything it's seen from texts online, then yeah, you're really gonna be replicating whatever that distribution online is."],"1285":["Yeah, it's a really tricky question.","As you said, these models are trained to, sort of, predict the next sequence of words, given a certain sequence of words.","So we could start with just, sort of, prompts like the woman was versus the man was, and, kind of, pull out common words that are, sort of, more used with one phrase versus the other.","So that's, sort of, a qualitative way of looking at it.","It's not ever kind of a guarantee of how the model is gonna behave in one particular instance.","And I think that's what's really tricky and that's why I, sort of, think it's really good for creators of systems to just be honest about, This is, sort of, what we have seen.","And so then, someone can make their own judgment about, Is this gonna be too high risk for, sort of, my particular use case?"],"1286":["I'm really interested in, sort of, the creative potential that we've started to see from NLP systems with things like GPT-3 and other really powerful language models.","It's really easy to write long grammatical passages thinking about the way that we can then harness, like, the human ability to actually give meaning to those words and, sort of, provide structure and how we can combine those things with the, kind of like, generative capabilities of these models now is really interesting."],"1287":["It has been far too long."],"1288":["Tooling that we now have, the capacity, and also, an elevation of the problem sets that we're dealing with and how to frame the problem.","And I'm almost struggling to figure out whether it's a blessing or curse that it has become as accessible and as democratized and as easy to execute and you just build another new company from scratch.","And so, what's been, kind of, your reflection on that?"],"1289":["In contrast, what I'm struggling with, the friend of mine who asked me to look at some health care data for him.","And despite the capabilities that we're having in all of the, kind of, bigger societal problems alongside with data collection engineering, all the gnarly stuff, that is actually not the machine learning itself, it's the rest of it where certain data isn't available.","And to me, it's staggering how difficult it is to get it off the ground and actually use."],"1290":["And how transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point?","What types of biases in the data collection, and then also in the usage?","We now call it the bias, but we're still struggling with the society not really living up to its expectations and then machine learning, bringing it to the forefront."],"1291":["Feeling increasingly challenged that my skillset of being very good at programming has become somewhat secondary.","And it's feeling... [both laugh] It's really the bigger picture understanding of Who would be using that?","How transparent do I need to build it for it to be adopted at some point?","What types of biases in the data collection and then also in the usage?","I think, in certain areas, we have societal expectations as to what is fair and what isn't."],"1292":["What have you seen in terms of which industries, where they stand, like who is adopting now?","Who is ready to utilize it?","Where would you maybe wish that didn't even try?","[Hilary laughs]"],"1293":["So I spent about eight years working in ad tech.","And the motivation was really because it was such an amazingly exciting playground to push that technology that used to largely live in academia, really, out in the world and see, kind of, what it can achieve.","It has created such a hunger for data that now everything is being collected.","I'm curious, when are we going to make a foray into things like agriculture about smart production of the things we eat?","You see and hear these interesting stories, but I feel like we're not ready yet to put that into a economically viable situation."],"1294":["I fully agree on the steps you pointed out and the processes.","I think there is a chicken and egg problem, like your former example, that these areas that need to wait for data, the value of the data collection is then also slightly less apparent.","And so, it gets delayed further and you'll see that happening.","But what my experience has been, there's unfortunately, I feel a drifting apart between academia and the uses of AI, but I am somewhat frustrated with a generation of students who have standard data sets that they never think about what the model needs to be used for, that they never have to think about how the data was collected.","So with all of these challenges ahead of us, how optimistic are you about this world that I deeply believe we can create and the steps towards it?"],"1295":["Despite that the rightfully raised concerns about the challenges ahead, but I think they also make us as a society better.","They challenge us to be a lot clearer of what fairness means to all of us.","So with all of the setbacks, I think we have exciting years to come.","And I am looking forward to a world where a lot more of that is used for the right purposes."],"1296":["Hi, I'm Robert J. Lang.","I'm a physicist and origami artist and today I've been challenged to explain origami in five levels.","If you know a little origami you might think it's nothing more than simple toys, like cranes or cootie catchers, but origami is much more than that.","Out of the vast cloud of origami possibilities I've chosen five different levels that illustrate the diversity of this art."],"1297":["Do you know what origami is?"],"1298":["Yes, in fact it is.","Have you ever done any origami before?"],"1299":["[Robert] Would you like to give it a try?"],"1300":["Okay, so we'll do some, but I want to tell you a little bit about origami.","Most origami follows two, I'll call them customs, almost like rules.","It's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts.","So these guys are folded from an uncut square."],"1301":["So you ready?"],"1302":["Okay.","We're going to start with a model that every Japanese person learns in kindergarten, it's called a crane, traditional origami design, it's over 400 years old.","So, people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years."],"1303":["Let's fold it in half from corner to corner, unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction, also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands.","We're going to bring these corners together, making a little pocket and then, this is the trickiest part of this whole design, so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge.","Now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that?"],"1304":["It's called a petal fold, it's a part of a lot of origami designs and it's key to the crane.","Now we're ready for the magic.","We're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger, reach inside, grab the skinny point that's between the two layers, which are the wings, and I'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle.","We'll take the two wings, we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane."],"1305":["Now, this is a traditional Japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they originated.","We're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher."],"1306":["So we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner, in one fold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center.","We'll fold it in half like a book.","On the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners and I'm going to fold it up through all layers.","There's a pocket in the middle.","We're going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together.","Where you have original corners of the square, we're gonna just pop those out.","This is one of the most satisfying moments, I think-"],"1307":["because it suddenly changes shape."],"1308":["Yeah, but there's something else we can do with this model.","If we set it down and push on the middle then pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth."],"1309":["There's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was, in fact, one of the first origami designs I learned some 50 years ago."],"1310":["So, what do you think of that?","What do you think of origami?"],"1311":["Thanks for coming."],"1312":["A lot of origami is animals, birds and things.","There's also a branch of origami that is, it's more abstract or geometric, called tessellations.","Tessellations, like most origami, are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns, whether it's woven patterns like that, or woven patterns like this.","If you hold them up to the light you can see patterns."],"1313":["The thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings, it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together, but they're still one sheet."],"1314":["There's no cuts in these just folding.","We can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds, learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces.","Can you make a fold that starts at the dot that doesn't run all the way across the paper?"],"1315":["Mm-hmm.","Each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds but if I made it the other way, then it's shaped this way and we call it a valley fold.","In all of origami there's just mountains and valleys."],"1316":["So they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat, it's going to be either three mountains and a valley or, if we're looking at the backside, three valleys and a mountain, they always differ by two."],"1317":["That's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and I'm going to show you a building block of tessellations, it's called a twist because that center square, as I unfold it, it twists, it rotates."],"1318":["If I had another twist in the same sheet of paper I could make these folds connect with that, and these folds connect with that.","And if I had another one up here, I could make all three.","And if I had a square array and all the folds lined up I could make bigger and bigger arrays, like these, because these are just very large twists.","In this case it's an octagon rather than a square, but they're arranged in rows and columns.","And let's just try going along.","All right, there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons.","So you have now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want."],"1319":["Yeah, so what do you think now of origami and tessellations?"],"1320":["That is a great definition."],"1321":["So here's a dragon fly and he's got six legs, four wings."],"1322":["Here's a spider with eight legs, ants with legs and these, just like the crane, are folded from a single uncut square."],"1323":["To figure out how to do that we need to learn a little bit about what makes a point.","So, let's come back to the crane.","You can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points, right?"],"1324":["That's a corner, four corners of the square, four points.","How would you make one point out of this sheet of paper?"],"1325":["Yeah, exactly.","Actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights.","Any flap, any point, leg of the ant, takes up a circular region of paper.","Here's our boundary.","To make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape, it's almost a circle.","If we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern.","Here's the crane pattern, and here's a boundary of the wing, and here's the other wing."],"1326":["The crane has four circles but, actually, there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this?","There's a fifth circle, which is like that, but does the crane have a fifth flap in it?","Let's refold it and put the wings up.","Well, yes, there is, there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane."],"1327":["And to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles.","So, each leg becomes a circle, each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick, like the head or the abdomen, can be points in the middle.","Now we have the basic idea of how to design the pattern, we just count the number of legs we want.","We want a spider, if it's got let's say eight legs, it's also got an abdomen, that's another point, and it's got a head, so maybe that's 10 points.","If we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider.","So in this book, Origami Insects II, it's one of my books and has some patterns, and this is one of them for a flying ladybug and, in fact, it is exactly this flying ladybug.","We've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts, knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles, smaller points will be smaller circles.","So any thoughts which might be?"],"1328":["Yeah, that's right."],"1329":["Mm-hmm, exactly.","And then the wings?"],"1330":["You've got it, so you are ready to design origami."],"1331":["Origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design, not just insects, but animals, and birds, and all sorts of things that are, I think, unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly, beautiful."],"1332":["That's so cool."],"1333":["Whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper, meaning it's big and flat, we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller."],"1334":["Telescopes, solar arrays, they need to be packed into a rocket, go up, but then expand in a very controlled, deterministic way when they get up into space."],"1335":["These are the building blocks of many, many origami deployable shapes, it's called a degree-4 vertex.","It's the number of lines.","So in this case, we use solid lines for mountain, we use dash lines for valley.","We're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms.","It's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity.","So what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid."],"1336":["So this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism.","You have one degree of freedom, I can choose this fold, and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined.","One of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here, the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this, as we're getting closer to 90 degrees, we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion, the opposite happens.","This one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the relative speeds differ."],"1337":["So when we start sticking together vertices like this, if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom.","So, these are examples of a pattern called the Miura-Ori.","When you stretch them out they're pretty big."],"1338":["And they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a Japanese mission that flew in 1995."],"1339":["Yeah, so typically the mechanism will run from corner to corner, to diagonally to opposite corners because then you can stretch it out that way.","Notice some differences between the one you have and the one I have in how this one sort of opens out almost evenly but this one opens out more one way and then the other."],"1340":["Infinitesimally small."],"1341":["So, sadly, the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers and then that's not useful."],"1342":["And it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices.","So these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions of motion.","And then the other difference is how efficiently they pack, so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact.","So if I were you making a solar array, I'd say, oh, I want that one.","But if I say, well, I want them to open at the same rate, then I want this one."],"1343":["There's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work.","And there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure.","This is a folded tube, it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly, it changes color.","There's a Mars Rover application where they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down, the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this."],"1344":["There are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians, like yourself, to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms.","And even though those studies are mathematically interesting, they're going to also have real-world applications in space, solar arrays, drills, telescopes, and more.","Any questions or thoughts about this?"],"1345":["The first thing I want to show you is origami in the real world.","This is the origami lamp.","It comes shipped flat but it folds, clip holds it together.","The lamp has LEDs on the inside so when we power it up we get light, we have a lampshade and we get the base."],"1346":["Origami applications have in common, is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3D state, or conversely, for deployables like space, you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3D state, or possibly an unfolded flat state.","Whenever a flat state is involved, origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states."],"1347":["This is another real-world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a Rover."],"1348":["New problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper, but also new opportunities.","An example here which is a kind of a variant of the Miura-Ori.","It's got a three-dimensional structure.","If I stretch it one way, it expands the other but because it has these S-bends in the pattern, if you squeeze it, it doesn't go all the way flat.","This is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if I put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom, this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong."],"1349":["Another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is if we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami.","We're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering, which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications."],"1350":["Yeah, so what goes in as sheet and what comes out is this, or something this wide."],"1351":["It's something we've talked about a little bit that with all the richness of behavior of origami from a flat sheet, it seems like there ought to be an equally rich world of things that don't start flat but are still made from flat sheets of paper."],"1352":["Bi-stable properties and you can combine them together with copies of themselves to make cellular structures.","They're astonishingly stiff and rigid, useful for mechanics."],"1353":["Is that where you fold paper to make different animals, like those?"],"1354":["Nope."],"1355":["Sure."],"1356":["That's awesome."],"1357":["Yep."],"1358":["Wow."],"1359":["Yeah."],"1360":["Wow."],"1361":["Okay, good."],"1362":["Yeah."],"1363":["I have seen these before, my friends use these."],"1364":["Wow."],"1365":["Wow."],"1366":["I think that the people that make them are talented.","It's hard.","Seeing the stuff that we've made here, I'd bet that they could do rocket ships.","Just so much that you can do with them."],"1367":["Thanks for having me."],"1368":["Wow."],"1369":["They weren't cut?"],"1370":["How about like that?"],"1371":["So all the folds are reversible?"],"1372":["Oh."],"1373":["Twists?"],"1374":["That was cool."],"1375":["Origami, I think, is the folding of paper to make anything in general, from 3D things to flat things and I think origami is about turning simple things into complex things and it's all about patterns."],"1376":["Wow."],"1377":["What?"],"1378":["Yes."],"1379":["I'm thinking of, like, a paper airplane."],"1380":["Okay."],"1381":["Okay."],"1382":["Well, the legs and the antenna would probably have to be these smaller ones, in the middle."],"1383":["[College Student] Oh, this looks like the back 'cause there's a bunch of circles all the way down, like here."],"1384":["You've got four big wings which you could see on the ends there and then, I guess, the head."],"1385":["Awesome."],"1386":["Wow, that's so impressive.","I think I learned how to make one of these paper cranes when I was in third grade but I guess I never unfolded it to actually see where it was coming from.","And so now that it's all broken up into circles it makes these super complicated insects and animals and everything seem so much simpler, so that's so cool.","I'm pretty excited about it."],"1387":["Thank you so much for telling me about this."],"1388":["Right."],"1389":["Okay."],"1390":["[Grad Student] Okay."],"1391":["Right."],"1392":["Okay."],"1393":["So then you like fly it up compactly and then once you get up there, there's like some sort of like motorized mechanism, but you only need it on one fold."],"1394":["Yeah.","What sort of angle would you want so that they open up the same rate?"],"1395":["Okay."],"1396":["For sure, right, right."],"1397":["So, it's kind of a trade-off?"],"1398":["Interesting."],"1399":["If you want to send something to space it probably makes sense to do it compactly, so if you have something that you can fold up and then unfold, just one of the folds, that's going to be probably the easiest way to get something up there and expand it to what it needs to be."],"1400":["I'm Tom Hull, I'm a math professor, a mathematician.","I've been doing origami since I was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school, at least."],"1401":["Why does origami lend itself to, say, this type of application?"],"1402":["Another aspect of origami and origami mechanisms that has leant itself to many different uses is the fact that it's scalable.","When you have an origami crease pattern like the Miura-Ori used in solar panel deployment, the type of motion that you see happening here will happen whether this is on a piece of paper that's small like this, or on a larger scale, or even on a smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller scale.","Engineers, in particular robotics engineers, are turning to origami toward designing mechanisms that will either be really big or really, really small.","This looks like the most promising way of getting nano robotics to work."],"1403":["Cool, so this is something that can actually get really, really tiny but then get big and fat and roll."],"1404":["Yeah!"],"1405":["So you're talking about a machine that is actually folding it into this, not just making the creases but actually folding it."],"1406":["That's cool, yeah.","What do you see as kind of like the next big breakthrough?","Is there anything out there on the horizon that you're just like, oh wow, this is really exciting?"],"1407":["So like a cone?"],"1408":["The thing that I think I'm the most excited about comes from math mainly.","When I look at origami, when I look at all these applications or just all these different origami folds, I see structure.","Math is really about patterns.","The patterns that we see in origami are reflecting some kind of mathematical structure and we don't quite know yet what all of that structure is and if we can tie a mathematical structure that's already well-studied to something we see happening in origami, then we can use the math tools right away to help solve the engineering problems and the origami problems.","And the fact that there's so many applications to this is really making people excited who are working in the area.","I'm really excited to see what happens with that in the next five years or so."],"1409":["My name's Bobby Kasthuri, I'm assistant professor at the University of Chicago, I'm a neuroscientist at Argonne National Labs.","(soft music) What the connectome is, is it's a kind of a newly made-up term for describing a kind of neuroscience research where we try to map the brain at a scale that's never been mapped before.","Every person here can leave with understanding it at some level."],"1410":["Do you know why we're here today?"],"1411":["Yes, we're gonna talk about science and we're gonna talk about a very specific kinda science, about people who study brains.","Do you know what a brain is?","What is it?"],"1412":["Definitely.","So what we're gonna talk about, this is something that people study in the brain called the connectome."],"1413":["Do you know that your body is made up of really tiny things called cells?"],"1414":["Okay, well there's more cells in your brain, like way more cells, than all the stars we can see.","(Daniel gasps) (Bobby laughs) And so what the connectome is, is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain."],"1415":["That was awesome, Daniel, thank you."],"1416":["Connectome."],"1417":["That's good, that's a great place to start.","There are cells in your brain.","Those brain cells are connected by wires to each other.","Electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain, and each of those brain cells makes, you know, a thousand connections, it's something like a hundred trillion connections."],"1418":["In one brain, in your brain.","Could I take all of that information and put it inside a computer?","Would that computer then be you?"],"1419":["I would say that that map also has your feelings in it because, here's why, your feelings, most neuroscientists think, come from your brain anyway, and amazingly, whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared, that's just brain cells communicating with each other."],"1420":["So, I think today we're gonna talk about a connectome.","Have you ever heard of that?"],"1421":["Yeah."],"1422":["Awesome, good.","(laughs) It's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain.","It literally, in a human brain, something like a map of the one quadrillion connections that a hundred billion neurons make with each other."],"1423":["Yes."],"1424":["Yeah."],"1425":["We have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing a way to slice the brain into really thin slices, use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice, and then use computers to put it all back.","Imagine that we could get a map of every connection, right?","And we knew how neurons fire.","Do you think we could put that in a computer, that map, and then therefore, that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from?"],"1426":["Neurons are also digital.","Meaning a Neuron either fires or it doesn't fire, so that's either one or zero.","And it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 thousand different answers that you say."],"1427":["Yeah, great."],"1428":["Huh."],"1429":["This is where it gets really crazy.","Could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain from which we made the map?"],"1430":["Huh."],"1431":["Because there's more to you in here than just information passing between neurons."],"1432":["Huh.","It would be like if you simulated a hurricane.","Imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane.","Ever.","Wind speed, every water molecule, et cetera, et cetera.","Temperature.","And we put that inside a super-fast computer and we simulated it, right?","I don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet.","Even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly, that wetness is consciousness, it's what we are.","Is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those, to explain alleged behavioral differences between them?"],"1433":["Wait, what do you think is sensitive?"],"1434":["Maybe a wiring diagram is not sufficient to understand the brain, and it would be crazy to think that that would be sufficient, actually."],"1435":["Sometimes when people get, they worry about connectomics, I think what they're actually worrying about is that it's the end of the that we used to do neuroscience."],"1436":["I'm not sure if you had a connectome of a human brain, of an adult human, I would be able to read out memories from that."],"1437":["It could absolutely be but without knowing what the weights were before the memory was made."],"1438":["Yes."],"1439":["So and a musician, how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains?","Meaning like, you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord, what if some of the learning is there?"],"1440":["Yeah.","We do a lot of X-ray in addition to EM and this is actually, I'm not saying it's the only problem, but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away, is that the data analysis, right?","In fact, I think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain where you collect every connection and et cetera so the problem is to get algorithms to trace, to recognize things in brains the way humans would recognize things in brains, or map things, trace things in brains.","It's gonna cost a lot of money to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and those are the kinds of ethical concerns that I'm worried about."],"1441":["One of the things that we're not doing well as a field is sort of educating and telling people beyond our field the benefits of what we could achieve but I'm impressed that when you talk to people about something that seems kind of crazy and outlandish and perhaps they hadn't been talking about before, it doesn't take 'em long to come to a kind of considered opinion, especially children.","I think it's kind of amazing.","I mean, I do hope that more people talk about brains and what we use brains for and the ways that we shouldn't use our brains.","So I think this field has the opportunity to make that more real."],"1442":["Because we're talking about science."],"1443":["Um, something that helps you remember things."],"1444":["Oh."],"1445":["Um, yes, I know that."],"1446":["Oh."],"1447":["Connectone?"],"1448":["To be honest, I have no idea."],"1449":["Whoa."],"1450":["Computers they don't have feelings, they won't have feelings and I think that's one thing that makes the human race strong."],"1451":["A connectome?"],"1452":["No, I don't think so."],"1453":["Is this like a map where, that's like an actual visual representation, like using microscopy?"],"1454":["Or just data?","Wow, wow."],"1455":["I'm understanding more so that it's these, a mapping of the circuitry, the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people."],"1456":["Well, the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options, it can only ask itself yes or no questions, but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go."],"1457":["It's a large scale attempt to understand the wiring map of the brain, essentially."],"1458":["I think that it's definitely needed."],"1459":["Understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely important but, it doesn't necessarily tell us everything about the function, there's some sort of temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region that we may not be able to pick up."],"1460":["I mean that's not the person, I mean, having a representation of someone's neural network is just that, it's just a representation of the neural network."],"1461":["I mean."],"1462":["I'd like to think so."],"1463":["Every single person is different and so it should be okay to map every single person's brain.","I mean I understand that there are, that it's very sensitive, you know?"],"1464":["Mapping an Indian brain versus a Caucasian brain, or, politically I think that people may have some issue with mapping out what causes or what makes a difference between different types of people."],"1465":["If you limit the connectome to be just the wiring diagram without, you know, more information about myelination or glial cells, all types of environmental features that surround the neurons and axons then you have an incomplete picture, no doubt."],"1466":["What do you think about memory?","Do you think that there's ways of resolving what the substrate of human memory is, you know, is it just LTP and LTD?"],"1467":["You don't think it's just the synaptic weights, like an artificial neural network that's trained to do particular things?"],"1468":["What if you had a violinist learn a piece of Bach music, could you find those notes somewhere in their brain if they didn't know before?"],"1469":["I'm a musician and I don't think it's possible.","I think that there are too many, you know, so much of it is associative to what you already know."],"1470":["Are you still doing EM or?"],"1471":["Hi, my name is Samy Kamkar.","I am a security researcher, computer hacker, and co-founder of Openpath Security.","I've been challenged today to explain one simple concept in five levels of increasing complexity.","My topic, hacking.","Hacking to me is using or manipulating a system in a way that it wasn't intended or really expected.","And that could be a computer or it could be a phone or a drone or a satellite.","It could really be anything."],"1472":["Do you know what computer hacking is?"],"1473":["Yeah, it's crazy.","They're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that.","They're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money, but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts."],"1474":["What they're trying to do is they're trying to even prevent the bad hackers from getting in in the first place."],"1475":["Yeah, exactly.","They're looking for ways that they can create protection.","It's kind of like the lock on your front door.","That lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't.","A hacker is essentially looking at a way, how can I get into this lock?","But then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock, hey, we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder."],"1476":["In many cases, they'll send them a new lock.","So it's an upgraded, better version.","Sometimes that's new features, but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well."],"1477":["That's a very good point.","You should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law.","They might work with the lock company and say, I'm trying to improve your product.","And they're trying to find these holes or problems, and then share that with the company.","Even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker, it's the same exact skillset, and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock, but your goal as a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected.","So hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys."],"1478":["I started doing the good hacking when I turned nine years old."],"1479":["I started going on the computer and playing video games, but I had some ideas of my own, and that's where I started to learn how to hack.","I wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look."],"1480":["That's entirely possible.","They may have done it for a reason, but you may have come up with a really good idea that, do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with?"],"1481":["When you have creative ideas like that, hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works, and that means you can change a game and how the game is played, and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game.","Once I started learning how to do it, I found that, things that were harder for me, I could make easier."],"1482":["I don't think my parents knew, but when my parents found out that I was doing it for good, I think they were happy."],"1483":["Do you do anything with computers or any coding?"],"1484":["[Samy] Interesting, so it's like a graphical interface where you can connect different pieces together.","Kinda like wire them together."],"1485":["Oh, that's pretty cool.","What do you know about computer hacking?"],"1486":["So on code.org, one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that.","Is that right?"],"1487":["Okay.","With computer hacking, it's actually the same thing.","Really, you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output, and actually you, as the designer, you're essentially designing games and software.","You're saying, well, I will only allow a user to really control these inputs.","Can you think of any inputs the computer might have?"],"1488":["Yep, there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device.","It's taking something from you, which is the sound and it's then transmitting that, ad it's actually sending it to me.","Are there any other things that you can talk to a computer?","You can give it information."],"1489":["That's absolutely another input that exists on your computer.","That's how I try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs.","Often, if you're trying to break something or hack something, you're really saying, okay, how can I control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected?"],"1490":["Typically, it's going to be something like the keyboard, right?","I'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware, but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates, and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory, so that if a computer shuts off, it stores something that wasn't memory like a password and stores it for a long enough time that I might be able to actually extract it through some other methods."],"1491":["It just depends what you're trying to do.","In some cases, it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works, and other times, it could be years.","So what have you learned about hacking?"],"1492":["Have you started studying cybersecurity?"],"1493":["Have you heard of the breach of Target where they were breached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked?"],"1494":["So where people are swiping credit cards, those credit card numbers were stolen.","They hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see, can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future?","And when this team came in, they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system, and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet-connected deli meat scale.","Once the company was able to essentially get into the deli scale, because the deli scale was on the internal network, then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system.","Essentially, that just got them into the network.","and once you're in the network, it's often really easy to then escalate from there."],"1495":["Yeah, that's another interesting concept.","It's really just different layers that we have for protection, because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network, or even your home network, you typically have sort of one level of defense, right?","If someone can break that or it can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol, like Bluetooth, right?","You can connect to a Bluetooth device without being on the wireless network, without being on the LAN.","That potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices, because if something has both Bluetooth and also Wi-Fi, well, if you can get in through Bluetooth, then you can then access the Wi-Fi and get to other devices on the network.","Are you familiar with buffer overflows?"],"1496":["If we were to write a program that asked for your name and you typed in your name, but before you could type in your name, in a low leveling, which is like C or C++, you'd have to allocate some memory.","So you might allocate a buffer of a hundred bytes because whose name is going to be longer than a hundred bytes or a hundred character?","But what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to a hundred bytes?","Do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that hundred bytes?"],"1497":["Absolutely, you would essentially cause a segmentation fault."],"1498":["But what's really cool about that is, when you're going into memory, you're starting to cross over that boundary of that hundred byte allocation, and now you're starting to write over additional memory.","That other memory is really important stuff.","So you have your name, the hundred bytes there, and then right next to your name is the return address, and that's the address that the code is gonna execute and it's going to return to after that function is done, and it's going to jump to that address, but after you type your hundred bytes, the next few bites that you type, you're actually going to overwrite that return address.","So that return address could essentially be another address in memory.","So what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name, it's really just code.","And that code, you keep typing until you get to the return address, and you start typing an address, which is really the beginning of your name and your computer or your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload.","So that was sort of the very first thing that I think was super exciting to me when I started learning about really reverse engineering."],"1499":["Ever since buffer overflow started many years ago, there been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit.","More and more, we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with smaller amounts of compute power.","If you take a car, you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there.","So they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows.","So how do we keep these low cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks?","Sometimes it actually is, how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering?","But oftentimes, it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of?","What got you interested in computer science and information security?"],"1500":["You brought up China and Iran, and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship, right?","They have essentially censored internet.","In the US, we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship, like Tor and other mechanisms.","While then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the NSA who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the US government is also funding."],"1501":["It's good for us to understand how these systems can really break down.","Although, I think one thing that I see is that some of, let's say, the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information.","They might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket and use it when it's advantageous to them."],"1502":["What kind of projects are you working on?"],"1503":["So essentially it's a really, definitely a stripped down operating system, or I guess it's a virtual machine."],"1504":["Have you done any work in side channel analysis?"],"1505":["So the side channel analysis is really looking not at a vulnerability within a system, but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on.","A very simple example of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if there are horses coming towards you, and the same thing applies to technology.","So you can have something like a CPU, it's executing instructions, certain instructions that use a little bit more power, and power is reserved in these capacitors, which are like tiny batteries next to your CPU.","And as they're pulling power, there's something in physics called the electrostrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very, very tiny amount.","And then although we can't hear it, the microphone on a mobile device can actually listen to that.","If you then listen to that and you say, oh, I see a pattern here, and you can go all the way down and then extract and reveal the full password, the full key, even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself, there's no problem with it."],"1506":["Yeah, I suppose the physical adjacency of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that storage.","That's crazy.","I think the first time I heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about the cold boot attack.","Being able to, you know, someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they walk away.","Being able to extract that password is really difficult.","If I can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory, put it in my own device, except the problem is memory is volatile, so it'll erase as soon as I pull it out.","You can take something like canned air, turn it upside down, cool that computer, make it real nice and cool.","Then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory, put into your own device, extract the memory, and then you're good.","It's such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical.","Like Rowhammer, it's such a low level of vulnerability and you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the architecture itself, but rather exploitation of physics at that point."],"1507":["I keep forgetting to update my fridge."],"1508":["That's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless, right?","If you wanna use a wireless router."],"1509":["The risk right now, just during this quarantine, is actually massive now that we think about it, because you might have these legacy systems.","You know, they were built 20, 30 years ago, and it's too costly to upgrade, but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a single location, so potentially, they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet.","Have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do?"],"1510":["Especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased, right?","Something that you actually own."],"1511":["What if it were illegal?","Would you then do it?","Fortunately it's not today, right?","It hasn't been, you know, despite their attempts, none of that has been passed, but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it, but all of a sudden, it passed, I mean."],"1512":["But the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone.","I ethically think similar to you in that, you know, what is moral to me is as long as I'm not intentionally hurting others, right?"],"1513":["I think we see every day that ethics and the laws aren't necessarily the same thing all the time."],"1514":["Hey Colin, we already know each other, but why don't you introduce yourself for the people watching?"],"1515":["What have you been up to?","And yeah, what are you working on?"],"1516":["Maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours, Jasper gave a example of fault injection, and I like to use that as, when I'm trying to explain fault injection, he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine, obviously the two inputs are the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine, but fault injection, you can tilt the entire pinball machine, right?","You're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in a advantageous way to the user or the player.","Can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on?"],"1517":["We're also scratching the surface of, like, what is possible?","It's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself.","Like you said, you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases.","You can just attack that check.","And I think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles.","It's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm, but I think it'd be really, really cool to actually see.","Like, I want to see one of these faults because I haven't seen it myself.","And also, how do you know that you've seen it?","I've started playing with, like, setting up a cloud chamber.","A cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol.","And I thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there, like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data, but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch.","Assuming that there is a high energy particle that actually hits that memory, that should potentially flip the energy state of that bit.","The outside microcontrollers should be able to read that and actually say, Oh wait, the data, even though I'm not changing data, I'm only reading data, and we should be able to visibly or optically see it.","What I'm wondering is could that be a next area of research?","Because I don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer, when really, you know, that's another technique for fault injection, technically speaking."],"1518":["You mean flipping bits within flash?"],"1519":["I've never seen... Maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it, right?","We know it's true, you know, you can get skin cancer by going outside and having too many high energy particles hit you, but we've never seen it.","And we know it can happen to a computer chip, but I've never seen both."],"1520":["The thing is, even if you know about that, then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about, because there's so many, I guess, potential areas for a fault to occur.","Where do you think security is going or new research is going?","Are there any new areas you think are coming out or are going to be more interesting, you know, pretty soon?"],"1521":["For me, I think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to physics-level effects that maybe we haven't seen before.","I think my mind was blown with the, there was the light commands research, and they were able to modulate sound, although it's purely over light using a laser, they would hit the MEMS microphone, and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially take control over light."],"1522":["It's the easier side.","I would say my side is the easier side, right?","I'm on the offensive side.","I want to break into things.","Someone on the defense side, they might have, you know, a system was developed and they now need to patch a hundred holes.","They patch 99 of them.","I only need to find that one."],"1523":["Yeah, only when you get caught."],"1524":["I hope you learned something about hacking.","Maybe next time a system behaves in a way that you weren't expecting, you might just be curious enough to try to understand why.","Thanks for watching."],"1525":["It's bad.","Like, I'm going into someone's personal account or account, changing some stuff or just stealing some information or your money."],"1526":["Do they, like, return the money?","Like, give them their money or something like that?"],"1527":["So they put like a protection account or something."],"1528":["What would they do about the people and the broken lock?"],"1529":["But like, they may get arrested because they might get mistaken."],"1530":["When did you start doing, like, the good hacking?"],"1531":["Wow."],"1532":["But that would be kinda bad, because maybe the creator did it for a reason."],"1533":["Yeah."],"1534":["Did your parents approve of it?"],"1535":["I like to play coding games, and I like to go on code.org, and they have a variety of games for different ages.","So like, I really like to do that.","For example, like the game Flappy Bird, it's like puzzle pieces, so they would tell you to connect something and then you would play the game and then you could see what you connected."],"1536":["[Linda] Yeah."],"1537":["I don't really know much about computer hacking actually."],"1538":["Yeah."],"1539":["[Linda] Space bar."],"1540":["Camera."],"1541":["What inputs would you normally use to hack?"],"1542":["How long does it take to get in?"],"1543":["I think hacking is actually really interesting.","There's different languages to hack in.","I've also learned that a lot of things could be hacked that you don't necessarily think that can be hacked."],"1544":["I started this year, I took my first course, so haven't gone too deep into it, but we got a basic idea of, like, basics of information and network security.","We learned about how networks are set up, like the different types of topologies, like Star and Mesh, and also how networks are designed with different levels of security."],"1545":["Yes, I heard about that."],"1546":["I've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment, but I'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack.","We discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use those to tap into networks."],"1547":["No, I am not familiar with that."],"1548":["In that case, it would be an error for accessing invalid memory."],"1549":["Yeah."],"1550":["So how does the buffer overloading relate to what you are doing in terms of network security or designing software for penetration testing?"],"1551":["I got interested in cybersecurity because I'm really into global affairs, global politics, and you often hear in the news about the rising power of China, the rising power of Iran.","I enjoy how interdisciplinary computer science is.","Like, nowadays there's so much going on in the world of computers and that's what fascinated me."],"1552":["There are a lot of ethical questions about whether we should be intervening in other countries, but it's pretty interesting that two different agencies of the government are actually working on contrasting technology.","I can actually understand that because if we are creating a technology that we are going to deploy somewhere else, we should know its limitations.","We should know how to control it."],"1553":["This is the end of my first year.","I'm a PhD student at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.","I'm studying security systems and operating systems.","So, security for operating systems.","I've been mostly working on a project that limits executables' exposure to bugs in the kernel.","It's run by professor Justin Cappos there.","He found that the majority of bugs that occur in the Linux kernel happen when you're doing things that people don't do that often, the programs don't do that often.","So designing a runtime environment that lets you limit what a certain program has access to, but also the things that it does have access to is also limited to those popular paths in the kernel.","So it can't access areas that aren't under more scrutiny."],"1554":["Basically, we're creating a user space operating system."],"1555":["Like, a little bit.","I read the Rowhammer paper.","I found it really interesting, but it's nothing that I've actually worked with."],"1556":["So all memory devices are just, it's just a bunch of gates and they're in rows.","They basically all hold different pieces of memory.","That's all the gates are.","Either they're turned on or they're turned off.","So what Rowhammer found was they tested a bunch of different memory devices and found that by doing a certain order of storing things, and then pulling that information back in a certain way in one place would actually flip gates in a different place.","So you could actually do a bunch of things to a piece of memory that had nothing to do with something that may be critical in a different place and actually change its contents, and that obviously exposes all sorts of security issues, because that's very hard to predict."],"1557":["I've spent a decent amount of time with this stuff, and in my mind, a lot of that is a nightmare.","Over the last year while I was doing some other stuff, I actually designed some microcontroller boards for a company that was doing stuff with, like, a smart watering project.","The problems with updating is just, like, that scares me the most.","Like, people don't update their own stuff, let alone these, like, devices."],"1558":["I find myself trying to shy away from owning like smart things."],"1559":["Yeah, I mean, there's obviously essentials, but yeah, no matter what, you can't really avoid any of this."],"1560":["Oh yeah, for sure.","When people find vulnerabilities, I think it's their duty to release those to the public."],"1561":["Yeah, I think that's nuts.","I'm firmly against that for sure."],"1562":["I don't know, probably, yeah.","[laughing] I don't think that's hurting anyone,"],"1563":["Yeah."],"1564":["Hi, I'm Colin O'Flynn.","I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.","I do hardware hacking both in academia at Dalhousie University, and in industry at my startup, NewAE Technology."],"1565":["Lately I've been doing, you know, always a little bit of side channel analysis.","So what I really do, you know, is all hardware layer.","So I've been looking, you know, at some various devices lately, at how susceptible they are to fault attacks, what that sort of means in real life.","You know, not just purely the research side, but also how much should you care about it."],"1566":["One of them was looking at, like, a little hardware Bitcoin wallet, and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it, and a lot of devices.","I mean, the whole idea is pretty cool, right?","Because you tell the device, Hey, I want to authenticate, and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it, but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math, you just attack the check at the end."],"1567":["This was actually tied into something recently I was looking at, which was, you know, flipping flash and EPROM memory."],"1568":["Yeah, exactly, right.","So flipping it in this sort of flash memory.","And so someone's done it with x-rays.","There's actually, I forget who now.","There's a paper, at least one, and it's just like a little plate they make with like a hole in it to concentrate the x-ray source and it works, so yeah, it's super interesting.","Like, one bit in memory means a lot, especially in the flash memory side.","Yeah, visualizing it would be cool though."],"1569":["Yeah, so actually, so it's funny you mentioned, like, making it more obvious.","I mean, staying on fault injection right now, this is lately what I've been up to.","A lot of making a little kind of, you know, like electronics kits of old, right?","And you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works.","So making something like that for fault injection.","So all kind of older logic and stuff like that.","So, I mean, it's sort of based on, like, you're presented the little MUX chip.","You know, voltage switcher.","That sort of idea, using just discreet logic to generate the actual glitch itself.","So, but you know, it's part of, I think, this stuff, right?","It's like people don't know about it sometimes.","Like, even engineers designing systems.","It's new to a lot of people."],"1570":["Fault injection has become pretty interesting.","Like, there's been a lot of people poking at that, and I think a lot more products of interest.","Side channel still might have a bit of a comeback.","Basically, what I kind of see is a lot of the really cool stuff has been in academia because product security hasn't kept up, right?","For the longest time, doing these attacks on hardware was pretty straightforward.","You didn't need these crazy attacks.","It looks like a lot of devices are coming out now that actually have real claims to security, right?","More than just a data sheet mentioned.","There's actually something behind it."],"1571":["I'm curious of the backstory to how they found that.","Because if you told me that, right?","So you said like, Hey, Colin, you should test this out.","I probably would be like, It probably won't even work.","Which is like a lot of side channels.","When I first heard about it, you know, working, doing firmware stuff, it was like, Oh, that sounds like it's not gonna work.","Like, that sounds impossible.","You know, the whole area of hardware hacking, it feels kinda like cheating because, you know, as you said, someone designing the system needs to know about so many different ways, right?","So there's so many ways to break the system, and if you're designing them, you need to know all of them, but when you're attacking it, you really need to know one, right?","So I can know nothing about, like, how does ECC actually work?","You know, I have some vague hand-waving I can tell you about, but if you gave me a pen and told me, like, Okay, write it down,
